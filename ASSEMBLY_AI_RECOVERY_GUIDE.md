## üìä Understanding the Results

### What Gets Recovered

For each transcript, you get:
- **Full transcript text** with speaker labels
- **Meeting metadata:** date, duration, word count, speaker count
- **Original Assembly AI data:** utterances, words, confidence scores
- **Recovery information:** marked as "recovered" with Assembly AI ID

### What About Duplicates?

The import script is smart:
- It checks if a meeting already exists (by Assembly AI ID)
- If found, it skips (doesn't create duplicates)
- Only new meetings are imported

---

## ‚ùå Troubleshooting

### Problem: "No completed transcripts found"

**Possible causes:**
1. Transcripts were deleted from Assembly AI servers
2. Transcripts are outside retention period (30-60 days)
3. Wrong API key
4. No audio was ever uploaded to Assembly AI

**Solutions:**
- Try "All available transcripts" option
- Check your API key is correct
- Verify you're using the right Assembly AI account
- Check Assembly AI dashboard: https://www.assemblyai.com/app/transcripts

---

### Problem: "API Error: 401 Unauthorized"

**Cause:** Invalid API key

**Solution:**
1. Check your `.env` file for correct API key
2. Verify you copied the entire key (no spaces)
3. Make sure you're using the Assembly AI key (not Google Drive key)

---

### Problem: "Some transcripts failed to recover"

**Possible causes:**
- Transcript is still processing
- Transcript had an error status
- Network issue during download

**Solution:**
- Note which transcript IDs failed
- Wait a few minutes and try again
- Check Assembly AI dashboard for transcript status

---

### Problem: "Import script doesn't work in console"

**Possible causes:**
- Script was truncated during copy
- Console has an error
- Browser security settings

**Solution:**
1. Try downloading the script instead (Step 9 Option B)
2. Open the file in a text editor
3. Copy from the file
4. Paste in console again
5. Make sure there are no errors before pressing Enter

---

### Problem: "Meetings imported but no transcript visible"

**Cause:** This should not happen with the new recovery tool (it properly maps transcript fields)

**Solution:**
1. Click on a recovered meeting
2. Press F12 ‚Üí Console
3. Check what fields the meeting has:
   ```javascript
   const meetings = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('meetingflow_meetings'))
   console.log(meetings[0]) // Check first meeting structure
   ```
4. Verify it has `originalInputs.audioTranscript`

---

- [ ] Verified all meetings appear in app
- [ ] Clicked on several meetings to confirm transcripts display
- [ ] Synced to Google Drive successfully

- Uploaded audio files (MP3, WAV, etc.)
- Full file transcribed at once
- Usually has `audio_url` field

**Streaming:**

- Transcribed as audio streams in
- May have different metadata

Both types are recovered the same way and converted to identical meeting formats.

### API Endpoints Used

1. **List transcripts:** `GET https://api.assemblyai.com/v2/transcript`
   - Returns paginated list of all transcripts
   - Includes metadata (date, duration, status)

2. **Get transcript:** `GET https://api.assemblyai.com/v2/transcript/{id}`
   - Returns full transcript details
   - Includes text, utterances, words, confidence

### Data Retention

Assembly AI keeps transcripts for:
- **Standard:** 30 days
- **Pro/Enterprise:** 60-90 days (check your plan)

After this period, transcripts are permanently deleted from their servers.

## üéì Understanding the Recovery Tool

The `comprehensive-assembly-recovery.html` tool is a standalone HTML file that:

1. **Runs entirely in your browser** (no server needed)
2. **Calls Assembly AI API directly** using your API key
3. **Processes data locally** (nothing sent to external servers)
4. **Generates JavaScript** that you paste in your app
5. **Is safe to use** (you can inspect the code)

The tool uses Assembly AI's official REST API to:
- List all transcripts in your account
- Filter by date range if desired
- Download full transcript data
- Convert to MeetingFlow format
- Generate import script

**Good luck with your recovery! This should get all your meetings back.** üéâ
