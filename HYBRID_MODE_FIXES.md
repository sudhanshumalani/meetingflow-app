# 🔧 Hybrid Mode Critical Bug Fixes

## 📅 Date: October 13, 2025

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### **BUG #1: AssemblyAI Service Singleton Architecture Flaw** ✅ FIXED
**Severity**: HIGH

**Problem**:
- The `assemblyAIService.js` used singleton properties (`this.ws`, `this.audioContext`, `this.processor`, etc.)
- When hybrid mode created two WebSocket connections (tab + mic), the second connection OVERWROTE the first
- This caused interference between connections and unpredictable transcript attribution

**Solution**:
- Added `connections` Map to track multiple concurrent connections
- Created `createIndependentConnection()` method to generate unique connection IDs
- Implemented `startRealtimeTranscriptionWithConnection()` for isolated connections
- Added `setupAudioProcessingForConnection()` for per-connection audio processing
- Added `stopConnection()` and `cleanupConnection()` for proper cleanup

**Files Modified**:
- `src/services/assemblyAIService.js` (lines 8-350)

### **BUG #2: Hybrid Mode Only Recording Tab Audio (CRITICAL)** ✅ FIXED
**Severity**: CRITICAL

**Problem**:
- When speaker diarization was enabled in hybrid mode, only tab audio was being recorded
- Microphone stream was completely excluded from the recording
- After recording stopped, speaker processing only received tab audio
- User's voice (microphone) was never captured in the blob

**Root Cause**:
```javascript
// OLD CODE (WRONG):
const audioTrack = displayStream.getAudioTracks()[0]  // ONLY TAB AUDIO!
const audioStream = new MediaStream([audioTrack])
mediaRecorderRef.current = new MediaRecorder(audioStream, ...)
```

**Solution**:
- Used Web Audio API to merge both tab and mic streams
- Created `AudioContext` with sources from both streams
- Connected both sources to a single destination
- Recorded the merged stream containing BOTH tab + mic audio

```javascript
// NEW CODE (CORRECT):
const audioContext = new AudioContext()
const tabSource = audioContext.createMediaStreamSource(tabStream)
const micSource = audioContext.createMediaStreamSource(micStream)
const destination = audioContext.createMediaStreamDestination()

tabSource.connect(destination)  // Merge tab audio
micSource.connect(destination)  // Merge mic audio

const mergedStream = destination.stream  // Contains BOTH!
mediaRecorderRef.current = new MediaRecorder(mergedStream, ...)
```

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/AudioRecorder.jsx` (lines 44-47, 312-370, 397-398, 662-704)

### **BUG #3: Second Recording Captures 0.00 MB** ✅ FIXED
**Severity**: HIGH

**Problem**:
- Second recording attempt captured 0 bytes
- Empty recording triggered speaker processing with 0 speakers
- Empty data triggered cloud sync which overwrote local changes
- All transcript progress was lost

**Root Causes**:
1. `recordedChunksRef.current` not properly cleared between sessions
2. MediaRecorder not fully stopped before starting new recording
3. No validation for empty recordings before processing
4. Cloud sync triggered on empty data

**Solution**:
1. Added MediaRecorder state check before starting new recording
2. Added 200ms delay to ensure previous recorder is fully stopped
3. Added validation for empty `recordedChunksRef` array
4. Added validation for blob size (minimum 1KB)
5. Added proper cleanup of `recordedChunksRef` after processing
6. Added clear error messages for failed recordings

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/AudioRecorder.jsx` (lines 316-325, 607-684)

## 🎯 Technical Changes Summary

### AssemblyAI Service Enhancements:
```javascript
// NEW: Connection management infrastructure
this.connections = new Map()

createIndependentConnection() → returns connectionId
getConnection(connectionId) → returns connection object
removeConnection(connectionId) → deletes connection
startRealtimeTranscriptionWithConnection(connectionId, stream, callbacks)
setupAudioProcessingForConnection(connectionId, stream, sampleRate)
stopConnection(connectionId)
cleanupConnection(connectionId)
```

### AudioRecorder Component Updates:
```javascript
// NEW: Connection tracking refs
tabConnectionIdRef.current  // Track tab audio connection
micConnectionIdRef.current  // Track mic connection
mergeAudioContextRef.current  // Audio context for merging streams

// NEW: Hybrid mode uses independent connections
tabConnectionIdRef.current = assemblyAIService.createIndependentConnection()
micConnectionIdRef.current = assemblyAIService.createIndependentConnection()

await assemblyAIService.startRealtimeTranscriptionWithConnection(tabConnectionIdRef.current, displayStream, ...)
await assemblyAIService.startRealtimeTranscriptionWithConnection(micConnectionIdRef.current, micStream, ...)
```

### Recording State Management:
```javascript
// BEFORE starting new recording:
if (mediaRecorderRef.current && mediaRecorderRef.current.state !== 'inactive') {
  mediaRecorderRef.current.stop()
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 200))
}
recordedChunksRef.current = []

// BEFORE processing:
if (!recordedChunksRef.current || recordedChunksRef.current.length === 0) {
  setError('Recording failed: No audio data captured.')
  return
}
if (audioBlob.size < 1000) {
  setError('Recording failed: Audio file too small.')
  return
}

// AFTER processing:
recordedChunksRef.current = []  // Clear for next session
```

## ✅ Expected Behavior After Fixes

### Hybrid Mode with Speaker Diarization:
1. ✅ User clicks "Start Recording"
2. ✅ Two independent WebSocket connections created (tab + mic) - NO INTERFERENCE
3. ✅ Both tab and mic audio streams merged for recording
4. ✅ Real-time transcripts show during recording with correct `[Tab]` and `[Mic]` labels
5. ✅ User clicks "Stop Recording"
6. ✅ MediaRecorder processes merged audio blob containing BOTH sources
7. ✅ Speaker diarization receives complete audio with user's voice
8. ✅ Transcript displays with proper speaker labels
9. ✅ User clicks "Start Recording" again (second session)
10. ✅ Previous recording state properly cleaned up
11. ✅ New recording starts fresh with empty chunks array
12. ✅ Recording captures audio correctly
13. ✅ Speaker processing works for second session
14. ✅ Transcripts ACCUMULATE across sessions (not replaced)

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

- [ ] **Single Recording Session**:
  - Enable speaker diarization in hybrid mode
  - Start recording, speak into microphone while playing tab audio
  - Stop recording
  - Verify both tab audio AND microphone speech appear in speaker transcript

- [ ] **Multiple Recording Sessions**:
  - Enable speaker diarization in hybrid mode
  - Record first session (2+ seconds)
  - Stop and verify speakers identified
  - Start second recording immediately
  - Record second session (2+ seconds)
  - Stop and verify speakers identified
  - Verify transcripts from BOTH sessions are present

- [ ] **Short Recording Handling**:
  - Start recording
  - Stop immediately (< 1 second)
  - Verify error message: "Recording failed: No audio data captured"
  - Verify no empty data sent to cloud
  - Verify can start new recording without issues

- [ ] **Connection Independence**:
  - In hybrid mode, verify console logs show two unique connection IDs
  - Verify `[Tab]` transcripts labeled correctly
  - Verify `[Mic]` transcripts labeled correctly
  - No cross-contamination of transcripts between connections
