# Real-Time Tab Audio Streaming Implementation

## ✅ What Was Implemented

Upgraded from pre-recorded transcription to **real-time streaming** for live Zoom meetings.

## 🎯 Key Changes

### 1. AudioWorklet Processor (`public/audio-processor.js`)
- Runs audio processing **off the main thread** for optimal performance
- Converts Float32 to Int16 format required by AssemblyAI
- Processes audio in real-time with minimal latency

### 2. AssemblyAI Service Updates
- Added `startTabAudioStreaming()` method for tab audio
- AudioWorklet support with ScriptProcessorNode fallback
- Cloudflare Worker token authentication
- Removed dependency on pre-recorded blob uploads

### 3. AudioRecorder Component
- **Tab Audio Mode**: Real-time streaming (~300ms latency)
- **Hybrid Mode**: Dual WebSocket connections for tab + mic simultaneously
- Transcripts labeled `[Tab]` and `[Mic]` in hybrid mode
- Removed "processing..." delay after stopping

## 🚀 User Experience Improvements

| Feature | Before (Pre-recorded) | After (Real-time) |
|---------|---------------------|------------------|
| **See transcripts** | ❌ Only after meeting ends | ✅ During the meeting (~300ms) |
| **Processing time** | ⏱️ 30-60 seconds after stop | ⏱️ Instant |
| **Memory usage** | 💾 High (stores full meeting) | 💾 Low (streams) |
| **File upload** | 📤 Required (100MB+) | ❌ Not needed |
| **Latency** | ⏰ Minutes | ⏰ <1 second |

## 💰 Cost (Unchanged)

- **$0.15/hour** for both real-time and pre-recorded
- FREE tier: 333 hours ($50 credit)
- No additional cost for real-time streaming

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Architecture

```
Browser Tab Audio
    ↓
getDisplayMedia() (16kHz)
    ↓
AudioContext → AudioWorklet
    ↓
Float32 → Int16 conversion
    ↓
WebSocket (wss://api.assemblyai.com/v2/realtime/ws)
    ↓
AssemblyAI Real-Time API
    ↓
Transcripts (~300ms latency)
    ↓
React State → UI Update
```

### Hybrid Mode (Dual Streaming)

When user selects "Hybrid Mode":
1. Creates **TWO WebSocket connections** simultaneously
2. Connection 1: Tab audio stream
3. Connection 2: Microphone stream
4. Both transcripts merge in real-time with `[Tab]` and `[Mic]` labels

### Fallback Support

- **Primary**: AudioWorklet (modern browsers, off-thread)
- **Fallback**: ScriptProcessorNode (older browsers, on-thread)
- Both use same WebSocket streaming

## 📱 Platform Support

| Platform | Microphone | Tab Audio | Hybrid |
|----------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| **iOS Safari PWA** | ✅ Real-time | ❌ Not supported | ❌ Not supported |
| **Windows Desktop** | ✅ Real-time | ✅ Real-time | ✅ Real-time |
| **macOS Desktop** | ✅ Real-time | ✅ Real-time | ✅ Real-time |
| **Android Chrome** | ✅ Real-time | ⚠️ Limited support | ⚠️ Limited support |

## 🎉 Use Cases Enabled

### ✅ Now Possible:
- **Live Zoom call transcription** with real-time notes
- **YouTube video transcription** while watching
- **Google Meet/Teams** live transcripts
- **In-person meetings** with instant transcription
- **Hybrid meetings** (remote + in-person) with both streams

### 📝 Example Workflow:
1. Join Zoom call on desktop
2. Open MeetingFlow app
3. Select "Tab Audio Capture" mode
4. Click record, select Zoom tab
5. **See transcripts appear in real-time during the call**
6. Take additional notes alongside live transcripts
7. Export complete meeting notes with AI insights

## 🔐 Security (Cloudflare Worker)

API key **never exposed** in frontend:
```
Browser → GET token from Cloudflare Worker
        ↓
Worker → Generate temp token from AssemblyAI (with API key)
        ↓
Browser → Connect WebSocket with temp token (60min expiry)
```

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **iOS Safari**: `getDisplayMedia()` not supported (browser limitation)
   - **Workaround**: Use microphone mode on iOS

2. **Firefox**: Tab audio capture has limited support
   - **Status**: Works in Chrome/Edge/Brave

3. **Hybrid Mode Complexity**: Two simultaneous WebSocket connections
   - **Impact**: 2x bandwidth usage during hybrid recording
   - **Cost**: 2x transcription hours (one for tab, one for mic)

```

## 🎓 Next Steps

1. **Deploy Cloudflare Worker** (see `cloudflare-worker/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`)
2. **Add your AssemblyAI API key** to Cloudflare Worker
3. **Update `.env`** with Cloudflare Worker URL
4. **Test on desktop** with a Zoom call or YouTube video
5. **Enjoy real-time transcription!** 🎉

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Q: Transcripts not appearing in real-time?**
- Check browser console for WebSocket connection errors
- Verify Cloudflare Worker is deployed and responding
- Ensure AssemblyAI API key is valid

**Q: "Failed to get token" error?**
- Run `npx wrangler secret put ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY` again
- Check Worker URL in `.env` is correct

**Q: High latency (> 1 second)?**
- Check your internet connection
- AssemblyAI normally has ~300ms latency
- If using VPN, try disabling it
