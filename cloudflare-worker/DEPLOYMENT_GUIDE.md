# Cloudflare Worker Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy the AssemblyAI token proxy in under 5 minutes.

## Prerequisites

- Your AssemblyAI API key (you already have this!)
- A GitHub or email account (for Cloudflare signup)

## Step 1: Install Cloudflare CLI (Wrangler)

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
npm install -g wrangler
```

## Step 2: Login to Cloudflare

```bash
npx wrangler login
```

This will open your browser. You can:
- Sign up with GitHub (recommended - 1 click)
- Sign up with email (free)

No credit card required!

## Step 3: Navigate to Worker Directory

```bash
cd cloudflare-worker
```

## Step 4: Add Your AssemblyAI API Key

Run this command and paste your API key when prompted:

```bash
npx wrangler secret put ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY
```

When prompted, paste your AssemblyAI API key (it won't be visible while typing - that's normal).

## Step 5: Deploy the Worker

```bash
npx wrangler deploy
```

You'll see output like:

```
‚ú® Successfully published your worker!
üåç Your worker is live at:
   https://assemblyai-token-proxy.YOUR-USERNAME.workers.dev
```

**SAVE THIS URL!** You'll need it in the next step.

## Step 6: Update Your .env File

Copy the worker URL you just got, then go back to the main project directory:

```bash
cd ..
```

Open `.env` file and add:

```bash
VITE_ASSEMBLYAI_TOKEN_URL=https://assemblyai-token-proxy.YOUR-USERNAME.workers.dev
```

Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with the actual URL from step 5.

## Step 7: Update .env.production

Open `.env.production` and add the same line:

```bash
VITE_ASSEMBLYAI_TOKEN_URL=https://assemblyai-token-proxy.YOUR-USERNAME.workers.dev
```

## That's It! üéâ

Your Cloudflare Worker is now:
- ‚úÖ Deployed and running
- ‚úÖ Secured with your API key
- ‚úÖ Auto-scaling (handles any load)
- ‚úÖ FREE (100,000 requests/day)

## Testing Your Worker

You can test it in your browser by visiting:

```
https://assemblyai-token-proxy.YOUR-USERNAME.workers.dev
```

You should see a JSON response with a `token` field.

## Troubleshooting

```bash
npx wrangler tail
```

**Update worker code:**
```bash
npx wrangler deploy
```

**Update API key:**
```bash
npx wrangler secret put ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY
```
