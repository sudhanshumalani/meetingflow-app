      "audioTranscript": "because i think sometimes we're stuck locally and we know exactly who the players are locally what's going on and everyone's connected around here we all know each other but the national conversations are good and it's kind of just good to hear what's happening in different states federally and just kind of okay okay yeah so i thought it was great and it was really fun because we don't get to hang out i think we meet a lot but i think meeting is one thing but hanging out is another thing experience too like getting out of the state and just like the observations of such parties and when you're extremist school choice folks and then you've got your liberals and everybody kind of came together and just the idea that like we need some shifts and maybe those shifts look different in for people but there was data and conversation that really like i don't know resonated i think in different ways for each of us about that shift that needs to happen are you familiar with that one i attended few of the sessions online yeah and there was this one on the policy stuff like state policy stuff and there was somebody from florida and they had just announced a week back or a day back before about the new regulation and when i when i was i was listening to that i was like oh this definitely is not flying in colorado so i was like to your point like how like bipartisan yeah yeah that was the one yeah the veil of one which also had no yeah this is the wisconsin guy he was my favorite because they're still angry the whole time he looked so angry but he was it was yeah but then he came on his wisconsin yeah i would say it was like too many panels for sure like there needed to be more hallway time yeah or just like almost set up discussions like here are all the people that are working on ecosystem right here all the people that are running microschools funders here are all the you know policy policy votes just if you had those groups together those people it almost felt like it was set up better for virtual because you can sit and listen to a panel but the only thing was like they were only covering one of the rooms the main room like not all were covered but they said that they'll share video afterwards so that's the thing but now i'm like okay i'll probably transcribe it and then ask to share highlights you should definitely do it in some of them like we went to the search and data session at the very end it was the last session i think everyone was tired but if you had condensed that information from the two arkansas studies and the international study like you could have summarized it in about three minutes but like it took an hour and twenty minutes to get there yeah there was a there was a couple of sessions like that but overall i think it was too it underscored for me that there's still so many small schools solving the same problems and nobody's really figured it out and we're all i mean it's why we're doing this work because there's still so many really amazing innovative models that are popping up and they're doing all of it in house by themselves and isolated and so even at a conference like this you can see like they're looking for that was what was nice is like you get to connect and see people and it's like oh i'm not crazy for doing this i'm glad they had founders in the room i feel like that's oftentimes you go to these conferences and then they are not really geared towards founders unless it's something like a veilicon that's only for founders but these kind of like larger larger systems thinking conferences i don't feel like they really market to school founders mostly because they're busy but it was good i was pleasantly surprised yeah let's do a nice thing i saw a lot of familiar faces from across the country so that was exciting black founders i used to work with that's good that kind of validated all the thesis that you all are working on totally i guess yeah and i think it's helped us clarify recognizing that we're really after the pioneers we're working with some pilot schools right now and i think even that has helped us really clarify who is it that we want to work with on behalf of and what really excites all of us i think is like the third horizon type of school that's not just you know tweaking the system but it's really like radically rethinking and restructuring like a la loser these different models and seeing you know now we've had some convenings where we've gotten folks together and we were part of colorado startup week and that was really amazing we knew nobody really there it was all folks that just showed up and heard about us so it kind of opened up this new avenue of people and you know different lenses and experiences all with the same kind of throughline though we did colorado startup weekend and we had like fifty people come to our session which was great and it was very validating just to hear people that aren't in our normal connective tissue that we've met asking the same questions you know that the folks on the inside are asking as well and kind of providing more details around what they would even need us whether they're tech entrepreneurs or education entrepreneurs kind of stepping into the space like what they see as missing and i was like okay cool all right it feels good we're on the right track it's good to kind of look it was a good opportunity to look up and just be like okay and i think the more that we hold these meanings we meet with folks what is standing out is people are desperate for community we're saying that over and over i mean they stuck with us what two hours it probably would have been longer if you didn't have to jet at the colorado startup week just wanting to chat and like connect with others and then what we're also seeing is the same people need the same kind of support and resources and you had mentioned the last time we spoke that back office was still a huge and that's that continues to come up for us as something that people need so we're and at any stage like not just at the start hours and we're connecting you know where we know to connect and where there's already solutions in place but i think we're identify we're starting to identify like there's probably room for innovation here and a solution that you know maybe we become a part of that solution of that support and what that looks like and and then really like amplifying and how do we how do we help people know what's out there and help connect them so that they're not so lowly isolated and so yeah it's it's still definitely ecosystem work but i think we're we're finding these pinholes of like how do we nourish these individuals so that they can continue doing that good work right so i know you had mentioned in the email wanted to chat about lalo's but also like broader work that you're doing originally yeah the idea was la loses we need to start talking about just kind of some public options so we're just going to pick your brain on that and you know having a conversation with this group as well it was just like well let's also just give an update as to kind of what we've learned because i think we've all learned a lot over the last ten months yeah in the last two months in particular right i mean it's just i feel like each week we're like oh my god we learned we learned so in terms of an agenda what would you want to set for the just kind of like i mean we we would of course love to know like what our options that you know about that colorado school funds support that we can help schools like lalous and that's for us to all kind of learn oh hold on you're in the boat where you don't talk to oh you're in a boat where you should go talk to yeah yeah really about la luz four la los but also not for everybody in the ecosystem that we're speaking with because i think a lot of folks are you know they started in one bucket and now they're looking at is this the right am i in the right area some of them like or through ergo seeds as a homeschool enrichment or realizing like i think we're actually a full time school not a homeschooling how like what are my options now so part of that is just learning for us and then another piece is like is there an opportunity for partnership around back office support for some of these schools and locations and what could that look like right and exploring that yeah and yeah i guess and we also just want to learn what have you learned in the past few weeks and like yeah where have you so that's what i was about to start with that caveat is that like this whole innovations innovative schools strategy but it's for us also like we are also learning alongside this so like nothing is like oh what i shared two months back like probably might have been invalidated by now so so like yeah i think like in that spirit like just wanted to share like i can i'm happy to share some of the new things that we have learned we have learned and like some of the shifts that protect shifts but building on like what we were doing so i can i can share that so okay i can i can start so overall like if you look at where i shared about like our innovation school strategy like our overall fund goal is to support twenty five schools in five years we have supported ten right now eleven actually eleven schools right now these are both new school launches as well as expansion so if schools are adding around two hundred plus seeds to their existing space we are supporting them through a grant which helps them either move to a new facility or like grow their enrollment and if they require some additional growth funding there and then also like startup schools like that is most of the startup schools that we are supporting are coming through legacy fellowship in the spring so they they had two fellows last year that got approved this in june so they are opening the school next fall both of them are in springs both are in springs yeah both are in d eleven school district but they're new their newest fellows yeah so there are four four new fellows that are starting they started in july so they will be applying for their charters next spring so the current thinking is that two of those are in the springs one in d eleven one and d forty nine i mean springs is like d forty nine ot forty yeah and then the other one is still like finalizing jeffco like that area yeah is that that's not where's the one you met with yeah sarah no jen norris yeah yeah so she she's the one who's looking at denver metro area like still doing enrollment studies to figure out where micro school too right isn't she small or she bigger no no she can say it's a k maybe with your help and i guess there's been i'd love to understand she is trying to there's an old catholic school that's she has her eye on and it would absolutely give her the ability to get up to four or five hundred kids eventually yeah that's the that's the idea right now again trying to first do like enough enrollment like before designing a model of like is it three hundred or five hundred or how much how many students they can fill and then also trying different levels like if we do transportation if you don't do transportation like all those pieces so trying so working on that so and then the fourth one is in the grand junction rolling fork like that that area but that will be a smaller school compared to the other three what is when you talk about innovative what does that mean so i'll come to that so that this is just like a usual twenty five school plan but like our goal is like at least five to seven like we started with two to three now seeing the pipeline we move to five now we are at five to seven because since like last three months like we have been like either got in touch or like were approached by so we are seeing like a very strong pipeline of innovative schools so now right now like there are four buckets that we have shortlisted or four themes i would say so one i think we had shared about like the the rural micro school networks or like cluster of micro schools within the rural areas and i'll talk more about those the second one is more around career connected industry partnership schools and then the third one is more initially we had this in the same bucket but separated it out based on the models that we are seeing evolving is more of the next gen learning like how integrated ai is and part of not replacing like not the alpha school replication but like more human human in the loop so like the main thesis is that ai is helping the efficiency and there is an ai literacy component for high school students too but like more like not alpha school where we are like two hours a day two hours a day not that model yeah yeah i do i do but again like my biggest open question there is that if i want to say all kids how how much of access it provides to all i think that is where i'm like that needs to be tested so is there like what if the kids have special needs of any kind how does that i mean does that really fit every yeah is it inclusive is it like is the design really inclusive is the question that i'm i mean in theory i think they would say like okay it's only two hours so then you have the opportunity to work like a sped tutor or or some other kind of you know tutor to kind of come in at a different time but i don't know yeah and then also like trying to like again you know like why this is a pilot innovative school area for us is like this might work at forty five thousand dollars fifty thousand dollars a year per student like can it work in seventeen thousand dollars in denver metro is the thing that needs to be proven so that is the third bucket and the fourth bucket is and i would say like this is an area where we haven't done a lot but now realizing after putting together that document we were like hey we named this area but we haven't done so right now have started a couple of pilots there is the dual language bilingual school because when lydia and i worked in texas and like some of the other geographies like a lot of schools provided dual language bilingual and here the hispanic ladino student population or multilingual lingual learners population grew by thirty five percent but not enough models to cater to those needs so that is an intentional bucket for us within it might not be as innovative if i go to texas and say that hey can we get this model here but for here like i think they will have to adapt to the learning styles and like the policies here so so those are the four buckets now what that means is like so in in the rural innovation bucket we have hierarchies i think we have lydia and i shared our thesis about iraq these with you but but like so that was one and then justice and heritage academy in alamosa they are working with csi to submit a charter application now so they run the boces in tonito and they have applied for charter a couple of times and were denied multiple two times other part of the yeah basically yeah yeah yeah so they've been paid by through that both arin and michelle have been taking like significant pay cuts and then during the summer months they have to do other jobs to to make ends meet so so for us like we were like hey this school definitely needs like a more sustainable model so working with them to see if they can get this charter through csi again like authorization is an uphill battle there but that's something we are working on are you guys investing in any policy support for these schools to kind of help them through that process because i do feel like yeah so that ecosystem policy work is different again i'll come to that one is like direct school support and then also like reducing the barriers part is the whole separate area for us so so that is so in the in terms of like these micro schools the way we support is that for example hierarchies got their charter approved for up to two hundred fifteen students so we basically and then they the csp grant they got was also for the whole expansion so we basically said that if you're opening three to four micro sites in park county or beyond like that's what we are supporting so we gave them like a grant for three years to basically expand and serve more students but the goal was like can this first like once we have like milestones for each of those disbursements to make sure that the first site that they are launching is like one we are going there tomorrow so it'll be it'll be good to see how things are happening and i think they are breaking ground on their facility also i think sometime this week so so yeah that that was one and then with justice and heritage academy right now like most of the support is around helping writing their charter petition i just over the weekend i was discussing with them about hey how are we putting the budget together like is it like a single site or similar to hierarchies like doing a cluster because then that limits the csp like if you don't do that so we're trying to figure out like and then balancing it with like what can get through authorizing so so yeah trying to a b test both with with them and then like once they have conversations more with internal are they still working with yeah andrew has been andrew's working and then on the authorization side we are also both authorization and communications because just creating a buzz around them one family support need so working on the communication front we publish few articles or like some stories positive stories out there so that there is a more poll there i think that is something focusing on and then both andrew and craig hatcher he's working on like some of the grass stops grassroot engagements there too because again like even if to get released to csi they will require all this so we are trying to yeah they work with so right now i think for them focus is more on authorization and that was one of the biggest learning was like what we had assumed initially was getting authorized like it's at least five x more difficult or ten x more difficult in some especially in smaller like smaller rural areas because then like there is like one district school which is the main employer of the district and like there's a lot of like pushback from the community so that is that is on the rural so again providing them grant and then all these outside support so for just as a heritage academy connected them today to shannon who was at minga and starting her own work now so to help them like think through the budgeting and like different scenarios because she did with hierarchies so i was like might as well use the same scenario planning to are you guys contracting the school's paying no we probably at least for first two schools we will to see how it works and if it works well then probably extend the because i think like the grant that we have given like a small planning grant that we have given to justice and heritage academy that like it won't cover them yeah like otherwise it will take like probably fifty percent of their capital so probably will do like a broader because there are a couple of other schools and other two buckets also that require this support so we were like okay let's just so on that level we've attracted shannon too and we have a few other people online but i think like part of what cultivated would like to do is to partner with shannon or somebody like shannon to do that modeling for schools before they even like get to the point where they're looking for a charter or whatnot to make sure that it's feasible right and then also utilize again shannon or somebody like shannon to be the back office if you're great yeah i think that is something that's where like when she said like she's starting her own practice i was like okay like let's at least do like two three school pilot with them to see like how it turns out and then trying to also figure out like yeah what role philanthropy needs to play in supporting this and what's the minimum number of students across two three networks that will make it pay for itself kind of so yeah yeah i mean we've started talking to pilot schools and another founders across the state too about you know this back office support and like the cost of you know paying for all these different subscriptions and then but still needing to be able to speak to a person when they're doing budget modeling and everyone is like please yeah and somebody who understands yes and understands like maybe what it's like in this environment to be a full founder because i think initially they were working with like charter writing consultants and they were creating the budget and like more recently authorizers have become very tight around like hey this doesn't work so they require like some financial expertise to your point like ahead of submitting the charter is like is this even viable feasible or not i think we could also i mean i think there's also you know some marketability to the micro micro school but also just independent schools or innovative schools across the state for not just even in startup like okay i'm in year five i need to start scaling down from philanthropic support how like what are the holes you know in my in my budget just being able to kind of that's at least a lot of the founders that i'm talking to are most of them are not start in a startup phase like i think it would be unbelievably beneficial in a startup phase but i also think it would be really beneficial to have that financial assistance and kind of budget modeling and it's a shame that there's not something that exists that's like a score the sba score network for specifically for schools right yeah because to your point again i haven't spoken to as many entrepreneurs as you have but at least like when i was working when i started working with hierarchies and all the questions i used to ask about like hey have you done this scenario that scenario and then no like i'm just trying to and then like there was a lot of like verbal responses to that but i was like how does this quantify into numbers was on but when shannon started working and she started joining these meetings he was like okay let me pull the model and like they were like more concrete scenario planning with csp without csb like all those things like was very very helpful i mean i feel like it would help validate the founders you know and help them feel more prepared and feel more secure and i mean that's half the battle here it's like it's very business alive yeah and it's really hard when you're like you know the marketing person the nurse the educator the staff admin near the every person to then look up and be like okay like let me you know see how the full picture looks and to feel confident and i i mean these are frankly like business owners in addition to school leaders and so important i think the beautiful part about shannon those two too that she has worked with so many schools across the state that she understands the small modeling of them of how how many schools yeah what does that look like if you're trying to grow like hierarchies or staying where you are like i mean justice and heritage academy they want to keep the one sided yeah so that was that was another thing that we were solving for them of like hey they want to continue to run this and they want to open a charter school it required like legal assistance around like hey can this be under the same umbrella of a five one c three does it have to be separate then if it is separate how we do that like just navigating those questions is kind of something that legal assistance is is also required because yeah because like i think for micro school i also think that there are there are untapped funding streams in colorado's statute that need to be tapped in but like how do you navigate that and like work around your structure to be able to secure that depends on your model like student population you're serving and other things but that is another level which is in place but how to untap that is needs to be figured out to your question on the policy side of things on policy side i think those are the two things i have one is authorization piece like is there an easier way for innovative schools to get authorized route because a normal five hundred student charter school spending eggs dollars on getting authorized and have one hundred student three site micro school spending same amount of dollars like doesn't add up so yeah i mean and that's or even if it takes that then funders philanthropy sector needs to understand to to support that need upfront if it is one time if it is ongoing then like that's the different question problem to solve what was the second policy authorization authorization and then this funding like tapping the funding stream because like again fifteen thousand fourteen thousand fifteen thousand ppr including mil levy is still tight so like what other funding streams depending on the student population and all the things that you can tap in yeah to do that i think those are the two right the third theme that i talked about was more around industry partnerships and career connected learning so we have one founder that we supported this year justin scott he led the kip austin region and then moved here last year worked at rocky mountain prep and now starting his own school so this year he's building his model having conversations and will submit the charter application next year is he part of the new legacy or no no he's not so again like with legacy institute or legacy fellowship what we have figured is like more early stage or like first time school leaders like he has run a network so for him like it he requires different types of assistance more around navigating stakeholders versus like how do i run a school leadership development so it was a different support so we directed we directly do the incubation and so he's thinking of a high school nine through twelve so the larger region is to have like multiple industries but starting with aviation and aerospace for now so like there are therapy is going to go into that school sky school maybe not but i mean that that building is not sustainable that's why kill them not sure unless somebody is doing a fire sale and we are getting it achieved i'm ready to so for for that model like again similar to hierarchies like there is an incubation grant for ea zero once they get charter approved we will give like first four years of year zero plus first three years of funding to them startup funding and then also like similar supports like navigating authorization navigating facilities make keen connections so he's this week next week and so for the next three weeks he's visiting all the schools across the nation to to see where industry partnerships or aviation type of students like so we from growth front we had some of this connect so we made with those connections he's now visiting those schools and learning alongside yeah so he basically like he has he has created his thesis or a model now he's validating components of it of like hey what does signature experience nine through twelve look like what is the graduate profile that a student who goes through aviation or aerospace track at a twelve year old who want to be like oh i want to do aviation all my life like you know you never know so like what are the pathways for them and even like if it's not there are marketing courses there are finance courses which are also well in the same industry but can also be replicable to others so like how do we how do we not like box it in like one stream but then also like provide more so he's trying to like learn that from see he's going to davinci schools in la just one of my favorites i would have been a pharmacist that's where i wanted to be yeah but but yeah yeah yeah i think that's what's so hard sometimes about those types of models is like the lack of flexibility yeah so so that is where like i think even like the goal for him is like he he wrote down like seven different graduate profiles of like one like the goal is so i think some of some of the things around like cte models is also like the way people interpret it it is very different like for him it's like goal is to serve multilingual multilingual learners and then also get to more like higher aspiring higher paying jobs within these fields so like making sure that he is preparing kids for that so right now yeah i think again authorization is the biggest piece to solve there but then also modeling and this is going to be an expensive model so how do we figure out a facility solution for that because that's the only level we can figure out how to reduce that so those are the two big steps if somebody is doing fire sale yes i'm i'm up for it we can bank that building for a year do you have the fourth method like the next generation learning yeah so so again we'll be starting the leader search next week for so we are doing a partnership with magic school ai and doing a joint search to support a school for the next year learning again because they're there thesis like we were very aligned with their thesis like we are not replacing the teachers we are basically giving them tools too identify the so we are doing an international search we have hired a recruitment firm to help us do that so it will go out next week but then again it's it's going to be we are open to both like a a unicorn leader who knows the next where tech is heading and responsible ai and also run a school and nose enrollment and how to get students how to make it financially work if not then we probably might have to do like a more of a co founder or executive director school leader model where typically like for smaller schools like having this so trying to trying to figure out who that person and then magic school ai will do a lot of like technical training and like setting up the stuff but yeah so that is that is on the second third bucket and then dual language we just started the work so in roaring folk there is valley settlement sort of like no no choice options for hispanic latino families there so they are now doing like learning work of like should we partner with someone should we open a school the community sessions we did two community sessions there and working with a consultant who is taking them to tour to some of these dual language schools so once they see like hey this is the vision for the model and then we'll support them either through legacy or directly depending on the leader profile so yeah those are the four where again so to your question when we say innovative like this is more around one is like taking more risk and giving more upfront grant ear which we typically don't do for other schools or if they're coming through legacy legacy pays them and we only do something so ear is what we are doing additional and then also realizing some of these are more expensive models so trying to figure out how can we reduce the upfront cost and then all the other supports around authorization facilities on the policy front again this is an area where you will require lot of collective thinking and again with upcoming elections everything is in a flux like you can like nothing will pass right now just kidding so so yeah don't but again like trying to figure out like hey if there is a window of opportunity that opens what are the top ten things or top five things that we want to move forward with one of the things is like is there an easier way for innovative schools to get authorized the thing is like the challenge is like if some of like for example just in school if it is going to csi it basically gets excluded from all the bond money and district space and like other things which basically makes this model unsustainable so for him like the only way is to work with the district to get authorized which is blue charging so is there a is there a state incentive for the districts to to do some of this is what what we need to figure out on the policy side interesting it's interesting i was talking to superintendent on terms school district and they have she's done some innovative stuff with transcend and teacher modeling to make sure that they have more sustainable roles considered unable to hire a lot of the roles because they're so rural they also started the first like outdoor micro school as a district so it's district run it's a forest school like maxes out at one hundred ten kids i believe is that right but she was talking about the fact that they there's been a classical school that's been going for a charter more towards classical yeah they they got approved yeah they did they did get approved was that last week no so they they went for state appeal yeah and stayed basically said yes and sent him back to the district and they approved it i don't think the district did they did but now they are just negotiating the charter contract interesting okay that's new because she basically was like if they don't if they want to get approved and at this point three weeks ago she was saying that they hadn't that it will close some of their district schools and so they didn't have an incentive because the loan is enrolled into justin you know and they're too so the state appeal yeah so so that's how so state approved it state basically sent back to the district which was like you have to approve otherwise release them to csm interesting okay sorry yeah but but yeah to the point like getting every school authorized in the eca environment as well very difficult like there needs to be especially for smaller schools because again when we were doing the hierarchies enrollment study like this is one and a half hour park counties one and a half hour drive like you cannot expect one school in fair play to basically serve the whole county even though like the n size is small but like you're asking a family to drop the kid one in harsh each way with limited transportation like that's not yeah different geographies like again aurora denver denver metro some of the areas have high need but politics is not supportive like depends on that's why i said like this november elections we'll know more yeah agreed then smaller places like it's more of the rural dynamics and like small plays by the district everyone yeah is certainly yeah so biggest employer like you don't like even to get like three k added in one of the schools east inside eastern plains which preschool is not even under district purview but still district basically said that no so so like those are the things where like with i think it's very relational there so how you navigate those grass top relations is is what is needed there so yeah that's the biggest challenge of like again understanding if your district population is six hundred and you're taking fifty plus fifty students also it's like close to ten percent of the students which is tough for them so so there is a financial impact but then where the logic is not working and i'm we are trying to figure out how do we communicate that better is is like for example trinidad in sound forty percent of the students are going to neighborhood districts to attend the school there's a forty percent fourteen forty yeah because there's no good district option there like the logic of like we are bringing students back to the district you are getting five percent whatever management fees like you're getting more revenue this ppr is processed through you like yeah yeah yeah so so that is the that is the argument which or like story or derivative that needs to go is like if if there are like lot of out of yeah out of district definitely are you familiar with them the my tech high they used to be called no they used to be called open end yeah do you know matt bowman he started him and his wife started maitakai in utah and it's like a home school it started as like a homeschool enrichment online kind of program that you could get esa funds like families could use and get funds but they won't have transitioned to open end and what they do is they go from state to state and partner with the districts so that some of the ppr goes back to the district even though the child is not in the classroom in the district so they're basically doing running contracts with districts to offer this as like a service to homeschool families so and they're primarily focusing on states that don't have esas as a means of like trying to get so this was something i again i couldn't wrap my head around they were here but they got politically put yeah not surprising but like there is this micro school initiative or some micro school micro school solutions which takes like ten percent of the ppr to manage more than that yeah something within the boces takes on their sticks their contract okay yeah so i i heard that and i was like i mean we are already talking about financial sustainability challenges and then yeah i think it was around ten fifty right i don't know the exact okay this is your launch pad this is how but what's the service or like what's the supply side right now the only services that they have access to getting them a charter a contract school is the er proceeds go ahead but you get like more higher ppr then you get homeschool he's basically living in the gray of the language of the boces and all the schools that rochelle's taking they're all really exits too we go interesting yeah and they are accountable to the same things a charter would be sequentially so they like they do state testing they have to do this bed services you have to have all the same requirements of hours and then the education re envision boces is you know basically allowing these schools to work as a contract school underneath their education re envision school so these are they're contracting the students out and they're doing it across the state they're doing it with all types of schools and it's basically any you say but but the folks that we're working with have not found benefit outside of it open a door for them to the to just open they're not but we could do that we wouldn't take fifteen percent but the only thing is like as i said like authorization is the biggest challenge and that's probably that's their biggest usps is about the cost like what fifteen twenty percent yeah but most of them now know like they can do this for a year and helps them get launched it helps them get that enrolled in base and ground themselves in the community in which they're working in and then they can go to education re envision proceeds and just say i want to be separated from microschool solutions and so then the er boces only takes six percent which is similar to what a normal district would take for a charter yeah and they still are getting that full period people spending so it works out for them in the end it's just helping them recognize that and then we are been helping them with the financial modeling with that it's like but you never know like if district is going to be right okay with it what's the risk of that it doesn't matter it doesn't matter if they stay under the er boces if they want to become charter eventually then that is like a whole nother way but if they want to stay independent if they want to say yeah so they they only get ppr not the mill name so they will only get the state funding component is it not the main level i think it rounds out to be about nine thousand dollars per student so for most of these micro school founders i think it's eleven isn't it yeah yeah but by the time they get it yeah this twenty percent it's eight thousand dollars per student which for most of these it's helpful i think it's for hierarchies like their mil levies little higher because of there so like the like that's how they are making work which is still like five at least five thousand more than eleven thousand facility it helps yeah yeah so especially once someone helps them get a facility in the first place right in the first place yeah yeah yeah well sudanshu how can we continue to partner i mean i think there's a lot of really amazing energy i want you guys are doing and we're starting to it's really kicking into hind gear for us as well and we love to partner with you so as i said then count for when we were starting this is like the innovative schools pipeline that will emerge so the examples that i shared are much further in their work like there are three at least three others that we are talking to that might be fault twenty eight so they'll start working there so there are six or seven right now what we didn't account for is each school is going to take a lot of work and time both around authorization then facilities yeah exactly i'm the consultants we are working with is also the ad hoc support and that also like project management comes on us is like okay this conversation happened or like did we meet this person or that person like all those things like still we have to keep the track so that is where i'm like and again like for just as an heritage academy i reached out to shannon like if she's already part of like your support network is there an easier way to like just help coordinate that and then i'm happy to think through a solution where like if it's legal assistance or back office assistance or other assistance like you are like you cultivate is the point person and then you bring in like would that be helpful for you so lydia and i are at capacity i'm running behind already on like reaching out to like there are there are there are two emails that i need to send to justice heritage academy so i'm just like so that is where like i think and again it's not right on them like we have committed like hey we will connect you to this person that person but it's so that is where i'm i'm like is if there is a more structured support for them i think again i it's hard to define a support i know like there are themes there are themes i told you like okay financial like charter application they need a financial modeling support so that is just one example but like within that also then like there will be ten things that they need to figure out so so that is where i think what if we figure out like these are the four big areas like authorization finance facilities maybe one or two others even like i think like for justice and heritage academy example like they have been operating it as like a more like they have been running this like they will have to hire somebody to run this alamosa like how do they codify their academics or like what they have been doing their culture like that's their biggest plus so like will it be reflected in alamos or not like helping them think through some of that piece like those are the things that kind like there's a few so those are like five buckets and again we made the connection to greg hatcher to support on the authorization piece but like all the other pieces like individually managing and project managing that all things are moving is difficult so like that is where if we name like these are the five things what schools require and then what are the areas where like you all can support them like then we directly reach out to you versus individual folks like that could be more arditative and then like we can figure out the authorization like that's an area where we are like spending more time but like the other pieces are something which we can figure out how to support the school sounds super comfortable same thing with with justin like even though he's opening a charter schooling but he also requires somebody to write the chart of petition do the do the financials like so again i connected him to sharon but some of these things are like irrespective of the size of the school will remain same he might have a head start or academic codification but like the other things at kip like he used to work with a cfo they had a cfo and like a big finance team so he never went deep into all these nitty gritty live ideas so i understand with you like is there a number of students that you will not go below like when you're thinking about these innovative models like does it have to be a hundred students or more like is there is there flexibility there or are you guys putting kind of a stake in the ground at a particular student population number the answer is i don't know that's fine too one i don't know but then also it depends on the geography as well like this valley settlement school that i talked about like they cannot have more than one hundred students this lamar altavista in lamar like they cannot add more than sixty students there still open to supporting them just thinking again right i don't think you are working know that are all i would say i would say like to do non negotiables for us as one like the student population that they're serving like it has to be or at least either it is providing more access or like serving high free and reduced again it's difficult to kind of like have a very hard number to that like forty percent thirty percent because if i go to another district it will change but like if the school is intentional about like hey the district is thirty percent free and reduced lunch but we are committed to serving fifty that itself is like twenty percent more than the district so we are ok to do that even though it's fifty not sixty seventy eighty like there were schools but we are ok to do that so i'm just thinking about in relation to shannon the reason why i'm asking is i'm just thinking around i guess there way to have the cost go down for everybody including these larger schools that you're working with if she's able to work with you know smaller schools all over the state like is there a balance there for more of that fractional support yeah like is there a way to make it more accessible and price point wise for schools overall i mean if she's working with bigger schools that are in our portfolio and if subsidizes the cost of working with yeah even though if they are not in our schools i think that should be ok that was yeah yeah yeah no again it's hard to find back office providers who are flexible to do both when we were looking for hierarchies everyone said no all the usual names said no so understand that yeah so if she works with two big schools which allows her to do two or three more smaller schools and if there is a philanthropic gap to be filled i think it's it's fine that is part of our like more ecosystem development investments which is fine it just has such a long tail like of support for schools like that kind of yeah it's really i'm curious like what is your board how involved is your board and decision and what is your board ultimately like five years from now on a cfara school is funding as an auto charters is it creating hor school choice like where what does that trigger yeah so when we started last year it was twenty five schools twelve thousand seats so let's see but then we one of our board members pushed if it is that would you be ok with twelve more dsst schools across colorado and we'll be like done and we were like no that is not our impact we want model choice we want somebody to speak we want impact we want like so so then they were like ok then define what five years from now what we would look like and i can share that i don't remember but we created like ok to define our impact it's beyond just twelve thousand seats and twenty five schools because that is like and when we captured that like both lady and i were like yeah if we look at our time like where we are spending most of our time might probably just give us like two thousand seats of those twelve thousand but then like that is where that gives work gives us more energy but like doing the same as shannon model like doing the whole allows us to do that but our board pushed us on explicitly defining that like how many rural schools will be there at the end of five years how many so we couldn't put the number to it but we basically said that like this is how we are defining our impact ok because like because like if like the amount of time we are spending on let's say justice and heritage academy like if i only counted by twelve thousand seats frame like it our board will be like while you're doing but you you you could share that yeah i can i can share that what we created in terms of like broader definition of impact than just seeds now even after defining that the tension that we keep getting is the prioritization especially because of limited capacity like like it's an everyday question for like hey do i do a call with a developer that can help dssd open x school or do i get on that call like that is a tension like we haven't solved that like i don't want to say that by just defining our impact we solved this yeah so what are the other things that you if you think in five years where else are you thinking that you would love to have impact so one one is on so one is like the type of schools and the job like job of models like that is on the school side and on the ecosystem side there are other pieces of like more better facilities ecosystem so like if i have to define a vision for that is what we did in idaho when i was at growth fund because basically when we started the first school that we financed there there were two term sheets that we got and banks were like we cannot give more than sixty five percent loan to value and this is the interest rate take it or leave it and when i left csgf last year the school that we were financing got seventeen term sheets so and this was in and banks were ready to go to up to eighty percent loan to value and much lower interest rate that what cdfi is in idaho in idaho but dealing with the albertsons family foundation this is yeah so so albertsons basically albertsons basically so these are all the created we get a chance to visit so so what they did was basically like they they worked on the policy side of it so there is a revolving loan fund now which basically supports do that there is a role of philanthropy that closes the last five to seven percent of the gap and then the bank like there are more banks so like you can you can negotiate a better rate so so that is my vision for like facilities vision is there yeah how do we create like more options for it's sort of easy we don't have an albertsons here if i'm hearing philanthropy covered the last five to seven percent yeah so i mean that we have already budgeted for through blueprint and other partners that we are supporting but you're going to continue partnering with blueprint yes but like not like this innovative schools i don't think that's their model so that work will still continue but for the regular like academy of arts and knowledge wants to lease to own like that's the model bread and butter for blueprint they can do that and get them i mean it's saving them one hundred fifty thousand dollars per year which is like one and a half fe probably so why not so so those for those models yes and then for these innovative cases we'll have to figure out but the overall goal is still to like even for blueprint to work here like there should be a broader financing ecosystem and then like the part of the other vision is like now schools don't have to go to like hey this is the developer i need to go to this is the lawyer i need to find everything is said like once you decide like this is the building i need like there are things that happen in the process in the process and then the school leader was i i used to be on closing calls for these financing the school leader was used to be on the call but didn't speak a single word everyone was basically like thinking in school's interest and were negotiating with each other and basically like how do we deliver the cheapest solution to the school kind of a dispute so i that is my home but there is an example that how it happened i know how to kind of replicate yeah so so that is the other part of impact beyond schools like some ecosystem pieces how how often do you and lydia talk about ecosystem every day every day you probably authorization and facilities is where we get stuck every time so so yeah like we were in idaho three weeks back we took a developer from colorado springs on a learning trip because idaho has done this i mean even colorado has done this but going out of state probably captures more learning so so we went there and then we had a conversation so charter school and a developer partnership where developer has donated the land and site improvements to the school and then school has basically raised typical financing that has reduced the cost by at least four to five million dollars for so so that partnership structure is something that we wanted this developer to see and you were saying again this is the developer donating the land within the development that they're doing similar to what stead did too right similar but that was a forty like pretty high cost building yeah but like with the development did in fact give the land right that was kind of the whole yeah but i think like different structures in different parts like dsst has some developer partnership with oakwood homes like they there was a different structure stead has a different so there are examples here that we have captured but then with idaho it was like schools are getting sustainable on public dollars on these facilities but it requires i think one interesting thing that we learned there was why developers want to partner with schools charter schools are not district schools because they are required to set a set aside a land the challenge you know idaho that they are facing which here also in some districts should be true is that for new developments it is very difficult to pass a bond so for district to open a school it's a six seven year ten year cycle versus charter school is bringing the market money because like developers like their incentive is to sell homes their homes will not sell if there are no good schools so for them it's like ok we are donating three million dollars worth of land and like site improvements but it is getting us but for district like you are increasing the tax you are increasing xy like that's more load on the buyers so that's how they are kind of viewing it but some developers there were like very intentional i want one district school i want one classical school i want one xyz gem prep type of school so they were thinking more of a portfolio approach and that's why we took this developer of like hey you have a plan for next ten years these many homes can we take that portfolio strategic portfolio approach where you have district school but also two other models that families don't want now they decide like which model so we can figure out but at least have two more options there shouldach but you guys it was really wonderful talking to you yeah let's try to your point list down what are the areas where startup schools need support from like charter petition to authorization like everything and then let's figure out which areas we can build some support into purchasing or getting land at a significant discount from churches or leasing from churches they're just the largest landowner in the united states and i know they're suffering yeah so sunday well even the land that they own to be able to i don't know just to offset because right now i know a lot of them are trying to split and sell land because they can't really afford so i think in colorado there are three two main archdiocese one is everything north of east county line and then one is south of east county line i think and they basically have most of the property the challenge and at least for the north one like their cfo was like yeah we want to get rid of some of the assets that they have but they are more like we want to sell it closer to the market price okay which becomes at least in current denver market is seeing there's a grace presbyterian owns that whole stretch on santa fe between hounds ranch parkway and county line and so when they were doing all the construction on santa fe they leased their land to the construction so that it could live on their land while it was happening but talking with that church specifically they're like no we would like to have something good happen on this land that's not just you know another storefront or something because you know these individual churches care about what's happening and they realize that they can't really sustain all of it and so they need to offload some of that asset and several of the churches that we've least spaced around because they needed the revenue had similar scenarios where they have a large amount of land but they aren't using it and their church is struggling and so they're looking for revenue streams or ways again like very case to case if it's very difficult to get a loan on a leased land so if school is basically like i'll lease it for lease itself from the church but i will have to at least own loan banks are like okay it's very risky unless that lease is like ninety nine years or like whatever that number is but for a short term lease like if it's a five year lease or a ten year lease then they don't want to give it and that is where i think like blueprint can help is like if it's a smaller renovation then we can figure out sources for it and like blueprint has done a lot of leasehold improvements both in in washington and in california so that that is but if it's like a grounds up built on a land it will require fifteen twenty million or even if it's a smaller school it will require compared to their enrollment a significant number that is pretty difficult to finance so yeah i i think again depends on case to case what's the current structure of the like how much are we renovating all those pieces going to the only other thing i would say it is i don't want to view this leader for your next gen learning model but i could sure help with somebody if you don't find the unicorn please share the names as we are looking at those people as somebody who lives in the ai world the tech does all the curricular assessment and has led us okay i just don't want to be the one to lead it but i could support somebody if you don't find a unicorn in those pieces even if you do though i think yeah no i think it's important definitely yeah yeah i build ai tools right now for the curriculum that i wrote and the pieces that i did okay i will definitely we can out of that if you find somebody to support you in that one yeah again like it's a quick turnaround like from leader hire to submit the charter so we are prioritizing more on like putting those pieces but i'm pretty sure we will soon get into like academic model and like all those debates around and again it's a good opportunity to think through all those structures that we have used in education see time all those things but at the same time like make sure that it's like inclusive and accessible like that is the piece so in all the other models we were like okay what is the bed that we are making somebody is running the school and we are basically helping them make it financially so it's more financial or facilities risk here it's also academic less so it's like an academic financial and facilities in it like it's a it's a bigger challenge human centered design if you're familiar with certain horizon framework that getting smart chemo was not my school brain and so looking at ai as how do you support the educators doing the work rather than outsource everything to the ai and so how does it become more of a partnership is where i live when i'm not doing cultivated work so if you're very interested in a bigger chat about that i'd be happy to share kind of my thinking around that and see if it would be helpful for sure this was helpful thank you yeah no again like as i said all learnings probably some of these might be like hey we terribly failed in xyz but at least like some of these bets are like yeah we definitely need to make so yeah again like super helpful to hear your what you are hearing from others pool leaders as well because that kind of helps us inform like how do we build the ecosystem alongside which is again school in of itself cannot now operate and i guess i would just end with like the ecosystem work that i think we're also excited about is how do we push a little bit beyond what our kind of typical schools so that i keep hearing is schools we want to open up more schools we run a lot of seats but i don't actually think that's going to change education just by opening more schools so i guess i'm still very much the i'm going to be the person that pushes on the like so what's innovative about any of the things that were yeah opening or doing because yeah i would say we don't need another dsst you know i mean some neighborhoods might actually geographically i'm just thinking for in order for education to change in my opinion your opinion so don't you like we have to have some things that probably aren't schools actually we just need different educational learning opportunities that look very different so you know so i just i love mister face it's a little bit different so i made a note i will share that broader impact language that that we were i mean work in progress but i'll share that and it's all work in progress and we're going to continue to learn continue to grow and figure it out but in terms of next steps did i also just kind of hear this idea of can cultivated work on what i don't know if the sense of menu of maybe what we could offer areas of where we could support yeah yeah would that be helpful yeah that would be yeah definitely be helpful and then yeah we have some live examples that we all are working on as a starting point okay cool",

        "audioTranscript": "because i think sometimes we're stuck locally and we know exactly who the players are locally what's going on and everyone's connected around here we all know each other but the national conversations are good and it's kind of just good to hear what's happening in different states federally and just kind of okay okay yeah so i thought it was great and it was really fun because we don't get to hang out i think we meet a lot but i think meeting is one thing but hanging out is another thing experience too like getting out of the state and just like the observations of such parties and when you're extremist school choice folks and then you've got your liberals and everybody kind of came together and just the idea that like we need some shifts and maybe those shifts look different in for people but there was data and conversation that really like i don't know resonated i think in different ways for each of us about that shift that needs to happen are you familiar with that one i attended few of the sessions online yeah and there was this one on the policy stuff like state policy stuff and there was somebody from florida and they had just announced a week back or a day back before about the new regulation and when i when i was i was listening to that i was like oh this definitely is not flying in colorado so i was like to your point like how like bipartisan yeah yeah that was the one yeah the veil of one which also had no yeah this is the wisconsin guy he was my favorite because they're still angry the whole time he looked so angry but he was it was yeah but then he came on his wisconsin yeah i would say it was like too many panels for sure like there needed to be more hallway time yeah or just like almost set up discussions like here are all the people that are working on ecosystem right here all the people that are running microschools funders here are all the you know policy policy votes just if you had those groups together those people it almost felt like it was set up better for virtual because you can sit and listen to a panel but the only thing was like they were only covering one of the rooms the main room like not all were covered but they said that they'll share video afterwards so that's the thing but now i'm like okay i'll probably transcribe it and then ask to share highlights you should definitely do it in some of them like we went to the search and data session at the very end it was the last session i think everyone was tired but if you had condensed that information from the two arkansas studies and the international study like you could have summarized it in about three minutes but like it took an hour and twenty minutes to get there yeah there was a there was a couple of sessions like that but overall i think it was too it underscored for me that there's still so many small schools solving the same problems and nobody's really figured it out and we're all i mean it's why we're doing this work because there's still so many really amazing innovative models that are popping up and they're doing all of it in house by themselves and isolated and so even at a conference like this you can see like they're looking for that was what was nice is like you get to connect and see people and it's like oh i'm not crazy for doing this i'm glad they had founders in the room i feel like that's oftentimes you go to these conferences and then they are not really geared towards founders unless it's something like a veilicon that's only for founders but these kind of like larger larger systems thinking conferences i don't feel like they really market to school founders mostly because they're busy but it was good i was pleasantly surprised yeah let's do a nice thing i saw a lot of familiar faces from across the country so that was exciting black founders i used to work with that's good that kind of validated all the thesis that you all are working on totally i guess yeah and i think it's helped us clarify recognizing that we're really after the pioneers we're working with some pilot schools right now and i think even that has helped us really clarify who is it that we want to work with on behalf of and what really excites all of us i think is like the third horizon type of school that's not just you know tweaking the system but it's really like radically rethinking and restructuring like a la loser these different models and seeing you know now we've had some convenings where we've gotten folks together and we were part of colorado startup week and that was really amazing we knew nobody really there it was all folks that just showed up and heard about us so it kind of opened up this new avenue of people and you know different lenses and experiences all with the same kind of throughline though we did colorado startup weekend and we had like fifty people come to our session which was great and it was very validating just to hear people that aren't in our normal connective tissue that we've met asking the same questions you know that the folks on the inside are asking as well and kind of providing more details around what they would even need us whether they're tech entrepreneurs or education entrepreneurs kind of stepping into the space like what they see as missing and i was like okay cool all right it feels good we're on the right track it's good to kind of look it was a good opportunity to look up and just be like okay and i think the more that we hold these meanings we meet with folks what is standing out is people are desperate for community we're saying that over and over i mean they stuck with us what two hours it probably would have been longer if you didn't have to jet at the colorado startup week just wanting to chat and like connect with others and then what we're also seeing is the same people need the same kind of support and resources and you had mentioned the last time we spoke that back office was still a huge and that's that continues to come up for us as something that people need so we're and at any stage like not just at the start hours and we're connecting you know where we know to connect and where there's already solutions in place but i think we're identify we're starting to identify like there's probably room for innovation here and a solution that you know maybe we become a part of that solution of that support and what that looks like and and then really like amplifying and how do we how do we help people know what's out there and help connect them so that they're not so lowly isolated and so yeah it's it's still definitely ecosystem work but i think we're we're finding these pinholes of like how do we nourish these individuals so that they can continue doing that good work right so i know you had mentioned in the email wanted to chat about lalo's but also like broader work that you're doing originally yeah the idea was la loses we need to start talking about just kind of some public options so we're just going to pick your brain on that and you know having a conversation with this group as well it was just like well let's also just give an update as to kind of what we've learned because i think we've all learned a lot over the last ten months yeah in the last two months in particular right i mean it's just i feel like each week we're like oh my god we learned we learned so in terms of an agenda what would you want to set for the just kind of like i mean we we would of course love to know like what our options that you know about that colorado school funds support that we can help schools like lalous and that's for us to all kind of learn oh hold on you're in the boat where you don't talk to oh you're in a boat where you should go talk to yeah yeah really about la luz four la los but also not for everybody in the ecosystem that we're speaking with because i think a lot of folks are you know they started in one bucket and now they're looking at is this the right am i in the right area some of them like or through ergo seeds as a homeschool enrichment or realizing like i think we're actually a full time school not a homeschooling how like what are my options now so part of that is just learning for us and then another piece is like is there an opportunity for partnership around back office support for some of these schools and locations and what could that look like right and exploring that yeah and yeah i guess and we also just want to learn what have you learned in the past few weeks and like yeah where have you so that's what i was about to start with that caveat is that like this whole innovations innovative schools strategy but it's for us also like we are also learning alongside this so like nothing is like oh what i shared two months back like probably might have been invalidated by now so so like yeah i think like in that spirit like just wanted to share like i can i'm happy to share some of the new things that we have learned we have learned and like some of the shifts that protect shifts but building on like what we were doing so i can i can share that so okay i can i can start so overall like if you look at where i shared about like our innovation school strategy like our overall fund goal is to support twenty five schools in five years we have supported ten right now eleven actually eleven schools right now these are both new school launches as well as expansion so if schools are adding around two hundred plus seeds to their existing space we are supporting them through a grant which helps them either move to a new facility or like grow their enrollment and if they require some additional growth funding there and then also like startup schools like that is most of the startup schools that we are supporting are coming through legacy fellowship in the spring so they they had two fellows last year that got approved this in june so they are opening the school next fall both of them are in springs both are in springs yeah both are in d eleven school district but they're new their newest fellows yeah so there are four four new fellows that are starting they started in july so they will be applying for their charters next spring so the current thinking is that two of those are in the springs one in d eleven one and d forty nine i mean springs is like d forty nine ot forty yeah and then the other one is still like finalizing jeffco like that area yeah is that that's not where's the one you met with yeah sarah no jen norris yeah yeah so she she's the one who's looking at denver metro area like still doing enrollment studies to figure out where micro school too right isn't she small or she bigger no no she can say it's a k maybe with your help and i guess there's been i'd love to understand she is trying to there's an old catholic school that's she has her eye on and it would absolutely give her the ability to get up to four or five hundred kids eventually yeah that's the that's the idea right now again trying to first do like enough enrollment like before designing a model of like is it three hundred or five hundred or how much how many students they can fill and then also trying different levels like if we do transportation if you don't do transportation like all those pieces so trying so working on that so and then the fourth one is in the grand junction rolling fork like that that area but that will be a smaller school compared to the other three what is when you talk about innovative what does that mean so i'll come to that so that this is just like a usual twenty five school plan but like our goal is like at least five to seven like we started with two to three now seeing the pipeline we move to five now we are at five to seven because since like last three months like we have been like either got in touch or like were approached by so we are seeing like a very strong pipeline of innovative schools so now right now like there are four buckets that we have shortlisted or four themes i would say so one i think we had shared about like the the rural micro school networks or like cluster of micro schools within the rural areas and i'll talk more about those the second one is more around career connected industry partnership schools and then the third one is more initially we had this in the same bucket but separated it out based on the models that we are seeing evolving is more of the next gen learning like how integrated ai is and part of not replacing like not the alpha school replication but like more human human in the loop so like the main thesis is that ai is helping the efficiency and there is an ai literacy component for high school students too but like more like not alpha school where we are like two hours a day two hours a day not that model yeah yeah i do i do but again like my biggest open question there is that if i want to say all kids how how much of access it provides to all i think that is where i'm like that needs to be tested so is there like what if the kids have special needs of any kind how does that i mean does that really fit every yeah is it inclusive is it like is the design really inclusive is the question that i'm i mean in theory i think they would say like okay it's only two hours so then you have the opportunity to work like a sped tutor or or some other kind of you know tutor to kind of come in at a different time but i don't know yeah and then also like trying to like again you know like why this is a pilot innovative school area for us is like this might work at forty five thousand dollars fifty thousand dollars a year per student like can it work in seventeen thousand dollars in denver metro is the thing that needs to be proven so that is the third bucket and the fourth bucket is and i would say like this is an area where we haven't done a lot but now realizing after putting together that document we were like hey we named this area but we haven't done so right now have started a couple of pilots there is the dual language bilingual school because when lydia and i worked in texas and like some of the other geographies like a lot of schools provided dual language bilingual and here the hispanic ladino student population or multilingual lingual learners population grew by thirty five percent but not enough models to cater to those needs so that is an intentional bucket for us within it might not be as innovative if i go to texas and say that hey can we get this model here but for here like i think they will have to adapt to the learning styles and like the policies here so so those are the four buckets now what that means is like so in in the rural innovation bucket we have hierarchies i think we have lydia and i shared our thesis about iraq these with you but but like so that was one and then justice and heritage academy in alamosa they are working with csi to submit a charter application now so they run the boces in tonito and they have applied for charter a couple of times and were denied multiple two times other part of the yeah basically yeah yeah yeah so they've been paid by through that both arin and michelle have been taking like significant pay cuts and then during the summer months they have to do other jobs to to make ends meet so so for us like we were like hey this school definitely needs like a more sustainable model so working with them to see if they can get this charter through csi again like authorization is an uphill battle there but that's something we are working on are you guys investing in any policy support for these schools to kind of help them through that process because i do feel like yeah so that ecosystem policy work is different again i'll come to that one is like direct school support and then also like reducing the barriers part is the whole separate area for us so so that is so in the in terms of like these micro schools the way we support is that for example hierarchies got their charter approved for up to two hundred fifteen students so we basically and then they the csp grant they got was also for the whole expansion so we basically said that if you're opening three to four micro sites in park county or beyond like that's what we are supporting so we gave them like a grant for three years to basically expand and serve more students but the goal was like can this first like once we have like milestones for each of those disbursements to make sure that the first site that they are launching is like one we are going there tomorrow so it'll be it'll be good to see how things are happening and i think they are breaking ground on their facility also i think sometime this week so so yeah that that was one and then with justice and heritage academy right now like most of the support is around helping writing their charter petition i just over the weekend i was discussing with them about hey how are we putting the budget together like is it like a single site or similar to hierarchies like doing a cluster because then that limits the csp like if you don't do that so we're trying to figure out like and then balancing it with like what can get through authorizing so so yeah trying to a b test both with with them and then like once they have conversations more with internal are they still working with yeah andrew has been andrew's working and then on the authorization side we are also both authorization and communications because just creating a buzz around them one family support need so working on the communication front we publish few articles or like some stories positive stories out there so that there is a more poll there i think that is something focusing on and then both andrew and craig hatcher he's working on like some of the grass stops grassroot engagements there too because again like even if to get released to csi they will require all this so we are trying to yeah they work with so right now i think for them focus is more on authorization and that was one of the biggest learning was like what we had assumed initially was getting authorized like it's at least five x more difficult or ten x more difficult in some especially in smaller like smaller rural areas because then like there is like one district school which is the main employer of the district and like there's a lot of like pushback from the community so that is that is on the rural so again providing them grant and then all these outside support so for just as a heritage academy connected them today to shannon who was at minga and starting her own work now so to help them like think through the budgeting and like different scenarios because she did with hierarchies so i was like might as well use the same scenario planning to are you guys contracting the school's paying no we probably at least for first two schools we will to see how it works and if it works well then probably extend the because i think like the grant that we have given like a small planning grant that we have given to justice and heritage academy that like it won't cover them yeah like otherwise it will take like probably fifty percent of their capital so probably will do like a broader because there are a couple of other schools and other two buckets also that require this support so we were like okay let's just so on that level we've attracted shannon too and we have a few other people online but i think like part of what cultivated would like to do is to partner with shannon or somebody like shannon to do that modeling for schools before they even like get to the point where they're looking for a charter or whatnot to make sure that it's feasible right and then also utilize again shannon or somebody like shannon to be the back office if you're great yeah i think that is something that's where like when she said like she's starting her own practice i was like okay like let's at least do like two three school pilot with them to see like how it turns out and then trying to also figure out like yeah what role philanthropy needs to play in supporting this and what's the minimum number of students across two three networks that will make it pay for itself kind of so yeah yeah i mean we've started talking to pilot schools and another founders across the state too about you know this back office support and like the cost of you know paying for all these different subscriptions and then but still needing to be able to speak to a person when they're doing budget modeling and everyone is like please yeah and somebody who understands yes and understands like maybe what it's like in this environment to be a full founder because i think initially they were working with like charter writing consultants and they were creating the budget and like more recently authorizers have become very tight around like hey this doesn't work so they require like some financial expertise to your point like ahead of submitting the charter is like is this even viable feasible or not i think we could also i mean i think there's also you know some marketability to the micro micro school but also just independent schools or innovative schools across the state for not just even in startup like okay i'm in year five i need to start scaling down from philanthropic support how like what are the holes you know in my in my budget just being able to kind of that's at least a lot of the founders that i'm talking to are most of them are not start in a startup phase like i think it would be unbelievably beneficial in a startup phase but i also think it would be really beneficial to have that financial assistance and kind of budget modeling and it's a shame that there's not something that exists that's like a score the sba score network for specifically for schools right yeah because to your point again i haven't spoken to as many entrepreneurs as you have but at least like when i was working when i started working with hierarchies and all the questions i used to ask about like hey have you done this scenario that scenario and then no like i'm just trying to and then like there was a lot of like verbal responses to that but i was like how does this quantify into numbers was on but when shannon started working and she started joining these meetings he was like okay let me pull the model and like they were like more concrete scenario planning with csp without csb like all those things like was very very helpful i mean i feel like it would help validate the founders you know and help them feel more prepared and feel more secure and i mean that's half the battle here it's like it's very business alive yeah and it's really hard when you're like you know the marketing person the nurse the educator the staff admin near the every person to then look up and be like okay like let me you know see how the full picture looks and to feel confident and i i mean these are frankly like business owners in addition to school leaders and so important i think the beautiful part about shannon those two too that she has worked with so many schools across the state that she understands the small modeling of them of how how many schools yeah what does that look like if you're trying to grow like hierarchies or staying where you are like i mean justice and heritage academy they want to keep the one sided yeah so that was that was another thing that we were solving for them of like hey they want to continue to run this and they want to open a charter school it required like legal assistance around like hey can this be under the same umbrella of a five one c three does it have to be separate then if it is separate how we do that like just navigating those questions is kind of something that legal assistance is is also required because yeah because like i think for micro school i also think that there are there are untapped funding streams in colorado's statute that need to be tapped in but like how do you navigate that and like work around your structure to be able to secure that depends on your model like student population you're serving and other things but that is another level which is in place but how to untap that is needs to be figured out to your question on the policy side of things on policy side i think those are the two things i have one is authorization piece like is there an easier way for innovative schools to get authorized route because a normal five hundred student charter school spending eggs dollars on getting authorized and have one hundred student three site micro school spending same amount of dollars like doesn't add up so yeah i mean and that's or even if it takes that then funders philanthropy sector needs to understand to to support that need upfront if it is one time if it is ongoing then like that's the different question problem to solve what was the second policy authorization authorization and then this funding like tapping the funding stream because like again fifteen thousand fourteen thousand fifteen thousand ppr including mil levy is still tight so like what other funding streams depending on the student population and all the things that you can tap in yeah to do that i think those are the two right the third theme that i talked about was more around industry partnerships and career connected learning so we have one founder that we supported this year justin scott he led the kip austin region and then moved here last year worked at rocky mountain prep and now starting his own school so this year he's building his model having conversations and will submit the charter application next year is he part of the new legacy or no no he's not so again like with legacy institute or legacy fellowship what we have figured is like more early stage or like first time school leaders like he has run a network so for him like it he requires different types of assistance more around navigating stakeholders versus like how do i run a school leadership development so it was a different support so we directed we directly do the incubation and so he's thinking of a high school nine through twelve so the larger region is to have like multiple industries but starting with aviation and aerospace for now so like there are therapy is going to go into that school sky school maybe not but i mean that that building is not sustainable that's why kill them not sure unless somebody is doing a fire sale and we are getting it achieved i'm ready to so for for that model like again similar to hierarchies like there is an incubation grant for ea zero once they get charter approved we will give like first four years of year zero plus first three years of funding to them startup funding and then also like similar supports like navigating authorization navigating facilities make keen connections so he's this week next week and so for the next three weeks he's visiting all the schools across the nation to to see where industry partnerships or aviation type of students like so we from growth front we had some of this connect so we made with those connections he's now visiting those schools and learning alongside yeah so he basically like he has he has created his thesis or a model now he's validating components of it of like hey what does signature experience nine through twelve look like what is the graduate profile that a student who goes through aviation or aerospace track at a twelve year old who want to be like oh i want to do aviation all my life like you know you never know so like what are the pathways for them and even like if it's not there are marketing courses there are finance courses which are also well in the same industry but can also be replicable to others so like how do we how do we not like box it in like one stream but then also like provide more so he's trying to like learn that from see he's going to davinci schools in la just one of my favorites i would have been a pharmacist that's where i wanted to be yeah but but yeah yeah yeah i think that's what's so hard sometimes about those types of models is like the lack of flexibility yeah so so that is where like i think even like the goal for him is like he he wrote down like seven different graduate profiles of like one like the goal is so i think some of some of the things around like cte models is also like the way people interpret it it is very different like for him it's like goal is to serve multilingual multilingual learners and then also get to more like higher aspiring higher paying jobs within these fields so like making sure that he is preparing kids for that so right now yeah i think again authorization is the biggest piece to solve there but then also modeling and this is going to be an expensive model so how do we figure out a facility solution for that because that's the only level we can figure out how to reduce that so those are the two big steps if somebody is doing fire sale yes i'm i'm up for it we can bank that building for a year do you have the fourth method like the next generation learning yeah so so again we'll be starting the leader search next week for so we are doing a partnership with magic school ai and doing a joint search to support a school for the next year learning again because they're there thesis like we were very aligned with their thesis like we are not replacing the teachers we are basically giving them tools too identify the so we are doing an international search we have hired a recruitment firm to help us do that so it will go out next week but then again it's it's going to be we are open to both like a a unicorn leader who knows the next where tech is heading and responsible ai and also run a school and nose enrollment and how to get students how to make it financially work if not then we probably might have to do like a more of a co founder or executive director school leader model where typically like for smaller schools like having this so trying to trying to figure out who that person and then magic school ai will do a lot of like technical training and like setting up the stuff but yeah so that is that is on the second third bucket and then dual language we just started the work so in roaring folk there is valley settlement sort of like no no choice options for hispanic latino families there so they are now doing like learning work of like should we partner with someone should we open a school the community sessions we did two community sessions there and working with a consultant who is taking them to tour to some of these dual language schools so once they see like hey this is the vision for the model and then we'll support them either through legacy or directly depending on the leader profile so yeah those are the four where again so to your question when we say innovative like this is more around one is like taking more risk and giving more upfront grant ear which we typically don't do for other schools or if they're coming through legacy legacy pays them and we only do something so ear is what we are doing additional and then also realizing some of these are more expensive models so trying to figure out how can we reduce the upfront cost and then all the other supports around authorization facilities on the policy front again this is an area where you will require lot of collective thinking and again with upcoming elections everything is in a flux like you can like nothing will pass right now just kidding so so yeah don't but again like trying to figure out like hey if there is a window of opportunity that opens what are the top ten things or top five things that we want to move forward with one of the things is like is there an easier way for innovative schools to get authorized the thing is like the challenge is like if some of like for example just in school if it is going to csi it basically gets excluded from all the bond money and district space and like other things which basically makes this model unsustainable so for him like the only way is to work with the district to get authorized which is blue charging so is there a is there a state incentive for the districts to to do some of this is what what we need to figure out on the policy side interesting it's interesting i was talking to superintendent on terms school district and they have she's done some innovative stuff with transcend and teacher modeling to make sure that they have more sustainable roles considered unable to hire a lot of the roles because they're so rural they also started the first like outdoor micro school as a district so it's district run it's a forest school like maxes out at one hundred ten kids i believe is that right but she was talking about the fact that they there's been a classical school that's been going for a charter more towards classical yeah they they got approved yeah they did they did get approved was that last week no so they they went for state appeal yeah and stayed basically said yes and sent him back to the district and they approved it i don't think the district did they did but now they are just negotiating the charter contract interesting okay that's new because she basically was like if they don't if they want to get approved and at this point three weeks ago she was saying that they hadn't that it will close some of their district schools and so they didn't have an incentive because the loan is enrolled into justin you know and they're too so the state appeal yeah so so that's how so state approved it state basically sent back to the district which was like you have to approve otherwise release them to csm interesting okay sorry yeah but but yeah to the point like getting every school authorized in the eca environment as well very difficult like there needs to be especially for smaller schools because again when we were doing the hierarchies enrollment study like this is one and a half hour park counties one and a half hour drive like you cannot expect one school in fair play to basically serve the whole county even though like the n size is small but like you're asking a family to drop the kid one in harsh each way with limited transportation like that's not yeah different geographies like again aurora denver denver metro some of the areas have high need but politics is not supportive like depends on that's why i said like this november elections we'll know more yeah agreed then smaller places like it's more of the rural dynamics and like small plays by the district everyone yeah is certainly yeah so biggest employer like you don't like even to get like three k added in one of the schools east inside eastern plains which preschool is not even under district purview but still district basically said that no so so like those are the things where like with i think it's very relational there so how you navigate those grass top relations is is what is needed there so yeah that's the biggest challenge of like again understanding if your district population is six hundred and you're taking fifty plus fifty students also it's like close to ten percent of the students which is tough for them so so there is a financial impact but then where the logic is not working and i'm we are trying to figure out how do we communicate that better is is like for example trinidad in sound forty percent of the students are going to neighborhood districts to attend the school there's a forty percent fourteen forty yeah because there's no good district option there like the logic of like we are bringing students back to the district you are getting five percent whatever management fees like you're getting more revenue this ppr is processed through you like yeah yeah yeah so so that is the that is the argument which or like story or derivative that needs to go is like if if there are like lot of out of yeah out of district definitely are you familiar with them the my tech high they used to be called no they used to be called open end yeah do you know matt bowman he started him and his wife started maitakai in utah and it's like a home school it started as like a homeschool enrichment online kind of program that you could get esa funds like families could use and get funds but they won't have transitioned to open end and what they do is they go from state to state and partner with the districts so that some of the ppr goes back to the district even though the child is not in the classroom in the district so they're basically doing running contracts with districts to offer this as like a service to homeschool families so and they're primarily focusing on states that don't have esas as a means of like trying to get so this was something i again i couldn't wrap my head around they were here but they got politically put yeah not surprising but like there is this micro school initiative or some micro school micro school solutions which takes like ten percent of the ppr to manage more than that yeah something within the boces takes on their sticks their contract okay yeah so i i heard that and i was like i mean we are already talking about financial sustainability challenges and then yeah i think it was around ten fifty right i don't know the exact okay this is your launch pad this is how but what's the service or like what's the supply side right now the only services that they have access to getting them a charter a contract school is the er proceeds go ahead but you get like more higher ppr then you get homeschool he's basically living in the gray of the language of the boces and all the schools that rochelle's taking they're all really exits too we go interesting yeah and they are accountable to the same things a charter would be sequentially so they like they do state testing they have to do this bed services you have to have all the same requirements of hours and then the education re envision boces is you know basically allowing these schools to work as a contract school underneath their education re envision school so these are they're contracting the students out and they're doing it across the state they're doing it with all types of schools and it's basically any you say but but the folks that we're working with have not found benefit outside of it open a door for them to the to just open they're not but we could do that we wouldn't take fifteen percent but the only thing is like as i said like authorization is the biggest challenge and that's probably that's their biggest usps is about the cost like what fifteen twenty percent yeah but most of them now know like they can do this for a year and helps them get launched it helps them get that enrolled in base and ground themselves in the community in which they're working in and then they can go to education re envision proceeds and just say i want to be separated from microschool solutions and so then the er boces only takes six percent which is similar to what a normal district would take for a charter yeah and they still are getting that full period people spending so it works out for them in the end it's just helping them recognize that and then we are been helping them with the financial modeling with that it's like but you never know like if district is going to be right okay with it what's the risk of that it doesn't matter it doesn't matter if they stay under the er boces if they want to become charter eventually then that is like a whole nother way but if they want to stay independent if they want to say yeah so they they only get ppr not the mill name so they will only get the state funding component is it not the main level i think it rounds out to be about nine thousand dollars per student so for most of these micro school founders i think it's eleven isn't it yeah yeah but by the time they get it yeah this twenty percent it's eight thousand dollars per student which for most of these it's helpful i think it's for hierarchies like their mil levies little higher because of there so like the like that's how they are making work which is still like five at least five thousand more than eleven thousand facility it helps yeah yeah so especially once someone helps them get a facility in the first place right in the first place yeah yeah yeah well sudanshu how can we continue to partner i mean i think there's a lot of really amazing energy i want you guys are doing and we're starting to it's really kicking into hind gear for us as well and we love to partner with you so as i said then count for when we were starting this is like the innovative schools pipeline that will emerge so the examples that i shared are much further in their work like there are three at least three others that we are talking to that might be fault twenty eight so they'll start working there so there are six or seven right now what we didn't account for is each school is going to take a lot of work and time both around authorization then facilities yeah exactly i'm the consultants we are working with is also the ad hoc support and that also like project management comes on us is like okay this conversation happened or like did we meet this person or that person like all those things like still we have to keep the track so that is where i'm like and again like for just as an heritage academy i reached out to shannon like if she's already part of like your support network is there an easier way to like just help coordinate that and then i'm happy to think through a solution where like if it's legal assistance or back office assistance or other assistance like you are like you cultivate is the point person and then you bring in like would that be helpful for you so lydia and i are at capacity i'm running behind already on like reaching out to like there are there are there are two emails that i need to send to justice heritage academy so i'm just like so that is where like i think and again it's not right on them like we have committed like hey we will connect you to this person that person but it's so that is where i'm i'm like is if there is a more structured support for them i think again i it's hard to define a support i know like there are themes there are themes i told you like okay financial like charter application they need a financial modeling support so that is just one example but like within that also then like there will be ten things that they need to figure out so so that is where i think what if we figure out like these are the four big areas like authorization finance facilities maybe one or two others even like i think like for justice and heritage academy example like they have been operating it as like a more like they have been running this like they will have to hire somebody to run this alamosa like how do they codify their academics or like what they have been doing their culture like that's their biggest plus so like will it be reflected in alamos or not like helping them think through some of that piece like those are the things that kind like there's a few so those are like five buckets and again we made the connection to greg hatcher to support on the authorization piece but like all the other pieces like individually managing and project managing that all things are moving is difficult so like that is where if we name like these are the five things what schools require and then what are the areas where like you all can support them like then we directly reach out to you versus individual folks like that could be more arditative and then like we can figure out the authorization like that's an area where we are like spending more time but like the other pieces are something which we can figure out how to support the school sounds super comfortable same thing with with justin like even though he's opening a charter schooling but he also requires somebody to write the chart of petition do the do the financials like so again i connected him to sharon but some of these things are like irrespective of the size of the school will remain same he might have a head start or academic codification but like the other things at kip like he used to work with a cfo they had a cfo and like a big finance team so he never went deep into all these nitty gritty live ideas so i understand with you like is there a number of students that you will not go below like when you're thinking about these innovative models like does it have to be a hundred students or more like is there is there flexibility there or are you guys putting kind of a stake in the ground at a particular student population number the answer is i don't know that's fine too one i don't know but then also it depends on the geography as well like this valley settlement school that i talked about like they cannot have more than one hundred students this lamar altavista in lamar like they cannot add more than sixty students there still open to supporting them just thinking again right i don't think you are working know that are all i would say i would say like to do non negotiables for us as one like the student population that they're serving like it has to be or at least either it is providing more access or like serving high free and reduced again it's difficult to kind of like have a very hard number to that like forty percent thirty percent because if i go to another district it will change but like if the school is intentional about like hey the district is thirty percent free and reduced lunch but we are committed to serving fifty that itself is like twenty percent more than the district so we are ok to do that even though it's fifty not sixty seventy eighty like there were schools but we are ok to do that so i'm just thinking about in relation to shannon the reason why i'm asking is i'm just thinking around i guess there way to have the cost go down for everybody including these larger schools that you're working with if she's able to work with you know smaller schools all over the state like is there a balance there for more of that fractional support yeah like is there a way to make it more accessible and price point wise for schools overall i mean if she's working with bigger schools that are in our portfolio and if subsidizes the cost of working with yeah even though if they are not in our schools i think that should be ok that was yeah yeah yeah no again it's hard to find back office providers who are flexible to do both when we were looking for hierarchies everyone said no all the usual names said no so understand that yeah so if she works with two big schools which allows her to do two or three more smaller schools and if there is a philanthropic gap to be filled i think it's it's fine that is part of our like more ecosystem development investments which is fine it just has such a long tail like of support for schools like that kind of yeah it's really i'm curious like what is your board how involved is your board and decision and what is your board ultimately like five years from now on a cfara school is funding as an auto charters is it creating hor school choice like where what does that trigger yeah so when we started last year it was twenty five schools twelve thousand seats so let's see but then we one of our board members pushed if it is that would you be ok with twelve more dsst schools across colorado and we'll be like done and we were like no that is not our impact we want model choice we want somebody to speak we want impact we want like so so then they were like ok then define what five years from now what we would look like and i can share that i don't remember but we created like ok to define our impact it's beyond just twelve thousand seats and twenty five schools because that is like and when we captured that like both lady and i were like yeah if we look at our time like where we are spending most of our time might probably just give us like two thousand seats of those twelve thousand but then like that is where that gives work gives us more energy but like doing the same as shannon model like doing the whole allows us to do that but our board pushed us on explicitly defining that like how many rural schools will be there at the end of five years how many so we couldn't put the number to it but we basically said that like this is how we are defining our impact ok because like because like if like the amount of time we are spending on let's say justice and heritage academy like if i only counted by twelve thousand seats frame like it our board will be like while you're doing but you you you could share that yeah i can i can share that what we created in terms of like broader definition of impact than just seeds now even after defining that the tension that we keep getting is the prioritization especially because of limited capacity like like it's an everyday question for like hey do i do a call with a developer that can help dssd open x school or do i get on that call like that is a tension like we haven't solved that like i don't want to say that by just defining our impact we solved this yeah so what are the other things that you if you think in five years where else are you thinking that you would love to have impact so one one is on so one is like the type of schools and the job like job of models like that is on the school side and on the ecosystem side there are other pieces of like more better facilities ecosystem so like if i have to define a vision for that is what we did in idaho when i was at growth fund because basically when we started the first school that we financed there there were two term sheets that we got and banks were like we cannot give more than sixty five percent loan to value and this is the interest rate take it or leave it and when i left csgf last year the school that we were financing got seventeen term sheets so and this was in and banks were ready to go to up to eighty percent loan to value and much lower interest rate that what cdfi is in idaho in idaho but dealing with the albertsons family foundation this is yeah so so albertsons basically albertsons basically so these are all the created we get a chance to visit so so what they did was basically like they they worked on the policy side of it so there is a revolving loan fund now which basically supports do that there is a role of philanthropy that closes the last five to seven percent of the gap and then the bank like there are more banks so like you can you can negotiate a better rate so so that is my vision for like facilities vision is there yeah how do we create like more options for it's sort of easy we don't have an albertsons here if i'm hearing philanthropy covered the last five to seven percent yeah so i mean that we have already budgeted for through blueprint and other partners that we are supporting but you're going to continue partnering with blueprint yes but like not like this innovative schools i don't think that's their model so that work will still continue but for the regular like academy of arts and knowledge wants to lease to own like that's the model bread and butter for blueprint they can do that and get them i mean it's saving them one hundred fifty thousand dollars per year which is like one and a half fe probably so why not so so those for those models yes and then for these innovative cases we'll have to figure out but the overall goal is still to like even for blueprint to work here like there should be a broader financing ecosystem and then like the part of the other vision is like now schools don't have to go to like hey this is the developer i need to go to this is the lawyer i need to find everything is said like once you decide like this is the building i need like there are things that happen in the process in the process and then the school leader was i i used to be on closing calls for these financing the school leader was used to be on the call but didn't speak a single word everyone was basically like thinking in school's interest and were negotiating with each other and basically like how do we deliver the cheapest solution to the school kind of a dispute so i that is my home but there is an example that how it happened i know how to kind of replicate yeah so so that is the other part of impact beyond schools like some ecosystem pieces how how often do you and lydia talk about ecosystem every day every day you probably authorization and facilities is where we get stuck every time so so yeah like we were in idaho three weeks back we took a developer from colorado springs on a learning trip because idaho has done this i mean even colorado has done this but going out of state probably captures more learning so so we went there and then we had a conversation so charter school and a developer partnership where developer has donated the land and site improvements to the school and then school has basically raised typical financing that has reduced the cost by at least four to five million dollars for so so that partnership structure is something that we wanted this developer to see and you were saying again this is the developer donating the land within the development that they're doing similar to what stead did too right similar but that was a forty like pretty high cost building yeah but like with the development did in fact give the land right that was kind of the whole yeah but i think like different structures in different parts like dsst has some developer partnership with oakwood homes like they there was a different structure stead has a different so there are examples here that we have captured but then with idaho it was like schools are getting sustainable on public dollars on these facilities but it requires i think one interesting thing that we learned there was why developers want to partner with schools charter schools are not district schools because they are required to set a set aside a land the challenge you know idaho that they are facing which here also in some districts should be true is that for new developments it is very difficult to pass a bond so for district to open a school it's a six seven year ten year cycle versus charter school is bringing the market money because like developers like their incentive is to sell homes their homes will not sell if there are no good schools so for them it's like ok we are donating three million dollars worth of land and like site improvements but it is getting us but for district like you are increasing the tax you are increasing xy like that's more load on the buyers so that's how they are kind of viewing it but some developers there were like very intentional i want one district school i want one classical school i want one xyz gem prep type of school so they were thinking more of a portfolio approach and that's why we took this developer of like hey you have a plan for next ten years these many homes can we take that portfolio strategic portfolio approach where you have district school but also two other models that families don't want now they decide like which model so we can figure out but at least have two more options there shouldach but you guys it was really wonderful talking to you yeah let's try to your point list down what are the areas where startup schools need support from like charter petition to authorization like everything and then let's figure out which areas we can build some support into purchasing or getting land at a significant discount from churches or leasing from churches they're just the largest landowner in the united states and i know they're suffering yeah so sunday well even the land that they own to be able to i don't know just to offset because right now i know a lot of them are trying to split and sell land because they can't really afford so i think in colorado there are three two main archdiocese one is everything north of east county line and then one is south of east county line i think and they basically have most of the property the challenge and at least for the north one like their cfo was like yeah we want to get rid of some of the assets that they have but they are more like we want to sell it closer to the market price okay which becomes at least in current denver market is seeing there's a grace presbyterian owns that whole stretch on santa fe between hounds ranch parkway and county line and so when they were doing all the construction on santa fe they leased their land to the construction so that it could live on their land while it was happening but talking with that church specifically they're like no we would like to have something good happen on this land that's not just you know another storefront or something because you know these individual churches care about what's happening and they realize that they can't really sustain all of it and so they need to offload some of that asset and several of the churches that we've least spaced around because they needed the revenue had similar scenarios where they have a large amount of land but they aren't using it and their church is struggling and so they're looking for revenue streams or ways again like very case to case if it's very difficult to get a loan on a leased land so if school is basically like i'll lease it for lease itself from the church but i will have to at least own loan banks are like okay it's very risky unless that lease is like ninety nine years or like whatever that number is but for a short term lease like if it's a five year lease or a ten year lease then they don't want to give it and that is where i think like blueprint can help is like if it's a smaller renovation then we can figure out sources for it and like blueprint has done a lot of leasehold improvements both in in washington and in california so that that is but if it's like a grounds up built on a land it will require fifteen twenty million or even if it's a smaller school it will require compared to their enrollment a significant number that is pretty difficult to finance so yeah i i think again depends on case to case what's the current structure of the like how much are we renovating all those pieces going to the only other thing i would say it is i don't want to view this leader for your next gen learning model but i could sure help with somebody if you don't find the unicorn please share the names as we are looking at those people as somebody who lives in the ai world the tech does all the curricular assessment and has led us okay i just don't want to be the one to lead it but i could support somebody if you don't find a unicorn in those pieces even if you do though i think yeah no i think it's important definitely yeah yeah i build ai tools right now for the curriculum that i wrote and the pieces that i did okay i will definitely we can out of that if you find somebody to support you in that one yeah again like it's a quick turnaround like from leader hire to submit the charter so we are prioritizing more on like putting those pieces but i'm pretty sure we will soon get into like academic model and like all those debates around and again it's a good opportunity to think through all those structures that we have used in education see time all those things but at the same time like make sure that it's like inclusive and accessible like that is the piece so in all the other models we were like okay what is the bed that we are making somebody is running the school and we are basically helping them make it financially so it's more financial or facilities risk here it's also academic less so it's like an academic financial and facilities in it like it's a it's a bigger challenge human centered design if you're familiar with certain horizon framework that getting smart chemo was not my school brain and so looking at ai as how do you support the educators doing the work rather than outsource everything to the ai and so how does it become more of a partnership is where i live when i'm not doing cultivated work so if you're very interested in a bigger chat about that i'd be happy to share kind of my thinking around that and see if it would be helpful for sure this was helpful thank you yeah no again like as i said all learnings probably some of these might be like hey we terribly failed in xyz but at least like some of these bets are like yeah we definitely need to make so yeah again like super helpful to hear your what you are hearing from others pool leaders as well because that kind of helps us inform like how do we build the ecosystem alongside which is again school in of itself cannot now operate and i guess i would just end with like the ecosystem work that i think we're also excited about is how do we push a little bit beyond what our kind of typical schools so that i keep hearing is schools we want to open up more schools we run a lot of seats but i don't actually think that's going to change education just by opening more schools so i guess i'm still very much the i'm going to be the person that pushes on the like so what's innovative about any of the things that were yeah opening or doing because yeah i would say we don't need another dsst you know i mean some neighborhoods might actually geographically i'm just thinking for in order for education to change in my opinion your opinion so don't you like we have to have some things that probably aren't schools actually we just need different educational learning opportunities that look very different so you know so i just i love mister face it's a little bit different so i made a note i will share that broader impact language that that we were i mean work in progress but i'll share that and it's all work in progress and we're going to continue to learn continue to grow and figure it out but in terms of next steps did i also just kind of hear this idea of can cultivated work on what i don't know if the sense of menu of maybe what we could offer areas of where we could support yeah yeah would that be helpful yeah that would be yeah definitely be helpful and then yeah we have some live examples that we all are working on as a starting point okay cool",

          "content": "because i think sometimes we're stuck locally and we know exactly who the players are locally what's going on and everyone's connected around here we all know each other but the national conversations are good and it's kind of just good to hear what's happening in different states federally and just kind of okay okay yeah so i thought it was great and it was really fun because we don't get to hang out i think we meet a lot but i think meeting is one thing but hanging out is another thing experience too like getting out of the state and just like the observations of such parties and when you're extremist school choice folks and then you've got your liberals and everybody kind of came together and just the idea that like we need some shifts and maybe those shifts look different in for people but there was data and conversation that really like i don't know resonated i think in different ways for each of us about that shift that needs to happen are you familiar with that one i attended few of the sessions online yeah and there was this one on the policy stuff like state policy stuff and there was somebody from florida and they had just announced a week back or a day back before about the new regulation and when i when i was i was listening to that i was like oh this definitely is not flying in colorado so i was like to your point like how like bipartisan yeah yeah that was the one yeah the veil of one which also had no yeah this is the wisconsin guy he was my favorite because they're still angry the whole time he looked so angry but he was it was yeah but then he came on his wisconsin yeah i would say it was like too many panels for sure like there needed to be more hallway time yeah or just like almost set up discussions like here are all the people that are working on ecosystem right here all the people that are running microschools funders here are all the you know policy policy votes just if you had those groups together those people it almost felt like it was set up better for virtual because you can sit and listen to a panel but the only thing was like they were only covering one of the rooms the main room like not all were covered but they said that they'll share video afterwards so that's the thing but now i'm like okay i'll probably transcribe it and then ask to share highlights you should definitely do it in some of them like we went to the search and data session at the very end it was the last session i think everyone was tired but if you had condensed that information from the two arkansas studies and the international study like you could have summarized it in about three minutes but like it took an hour and twenty minutes to get there yeah there was a there was a couple of sessions like that but overall i think it was too it underscored for me that there's still so many small schools solving the same problems and nobody's really figured it out and we're all i mean it's why we're doing this work because there's still so many really amazing innovative models that are popping up and they're doing all of it in house by themselves and isolated and so even at a conference like this you can see like they're looking for that was what was nice is like you get to connect and see people and it's like oh i'm not crazy for doing this i'm glad they had founders in the room i feel like that's oftentimes you go to these conferences and then they are not really geared towards founders unless it's something like a veilicon that's only for founders but these kind of like larger larger systems thinking conferences i don't feel like they really market to school founders mostly because they're busy but it was good i was pleasantly surprised yeah let's do a nice thing i saw a lot of familiar faces from across the country so that was exciting black founders i used to work with that's good that kind of validated all the thesis that you all are working on totally i guess yeah and i think it's helped us clarify recognizing that we're really after the pioneers we're working with some pilot schools right now and i think even that has helped us really clarify who is it that we want to work with on behalf of and what really excites all of us i think is like the third horizon type of school that's not just you know tweaking the system but it's really like radically rethinking and restructuring like a la loser these different models and seeing you know now we've had some convenings where we've gotten folks together and we were part of colorado startup week and that was really amazing we knew nobody really there it was all folks that just showed up and heard about us so it kind of opened up this new avenue of people and you know different lenses and experiences all with the same kind of throughline though we did colorado startup weekend and we had like fifty people come to our session which was great and it was very validating just to hear people that aren't in our normal connective tissue that we've met asking the same questions you know that the folks on the inside are asking as well and kind of providing more details around what they would even need us whether they're tech entrepreneurs or education entrepreneurs kind of stepping into the space like what they see as missing and i was like okay cool all right it feels good we're on the right track it's good to kind of look it was a good opportunity to look up and just be like okay and i think the more that we hold these meanings we meet with folks what is standing out is people are desperate for community we're saying that over and over i mean they stuck with us what two hours it probably would have been longer if you didn't have to jet at the colorado startup week just wanting to chat and like connect with others and then what we're also seeing is the same people need the same kind of support and resources and you had mentioned the last time we spoke that back office was still a huge and that's that continues to come up for us as something that people need so we're and at any stage like not just at the start hours and we're connecting you know where we know to connect and where there's already solutions in place but i think we're identify we're starting to identify like there's probably room for innovation here and a solution that you know maybe we become a part of that solution of that support and what that looks like and and then really like amplifying and how do we how do we help people know what's out there and help connect them so that they're not so lowly isolated and so yeah it's it's still definitely ecosystem work but i think we're we're finding these pinholes of like how do we nourish these individuals so that they can continue doing that good work right so i know you had mentioned in the email wanted to chat about lalo's but also like broader work that you're doing originally yeah the idea was la loses we need to start talking about just kind of some public options so we're just going to pick your brain on that and you know having a conversation with this group as well it was just like well let's also just give an update as to kind of what we've learned because i think we've all learned a lot over the last ten months yeah in the last two months in particular right i mean it's just i feel like each week we're like oh my god we learned we learned so in terms of an agenda what would you want to set for the just kind of like i mean we we would of course love to know like what our options that you know about that colorado school funds support that we can help schools like lalous and that's for us to all kind of learn oh hold on you're in the boat where you don't talk to oh you're in a boat where you should go talk to yeah yeah really about la luz four la los but also not for everybody in the ecosystem that we're speaking with because i think a lot of folks are you know they started in one bucket and now they're looking at is this the right am i in the right area some of them like or through ergo seeds as a homeschool enrichment or realizing like i think we're actually a full time school not a homeschooling how like what are my options now so part of that is just learning for us and then another piece is like is there an opportunity for partnership around back office support for some of these schools and locations and what could that look like right and exploring that yeah and yeah i guess and we also just want to learn what have you learned in the past few weeks and like yeah where have you so that's what i was about to start with that caveat is that like this whole innovations innovative schools strategy but it's for us also like we are also learning alongside this so like nothing is like oh what i shared two months back like probably might have been invalidated by now so so like yeah i think like in that spirit like just wanted to share like i can i'm happy to share some of the new things that we have learned we have learned and like some of the shifts that protect shifts but building on like what we were doing so i can i can share that so okay i can i can start so overall like if you look at where i shared about like our innovation school strategy like our overall fund goal is to support twenty five schools in five years we have supported ten right now eleven actually eleven schools right now these are both new school launches as well as expansion so if schools are adding around two hundred plus seeds to their existing space we are supporting them through a grant which helps them either move to a new facility or like grow their enrollment and if they require some additional growth funding there and then also like startup schools like that is most of the startup schools that we are supporting are coming through legacy fellowship in the spring so they they had two fellows last year that got approved this in june so they are opening the school next fall both of them are in springs both are in springs yeah both are in d eleven school district but they're new their newest fellows yeah so there are four four new fellows that are starting they started in july so they will be applying for their charters next spring so the current thinking is that two of those are in the springs one in d eleven one and d forty nine i mean springs is like d forty nine ot forty yeah and then the other one is still like finalizing jeffco like that area yeah is that that's not where's the one you met with yeah sarah no jen norris yeah yeah so she she's the one who's looking at denver metro area like still doing enrollment studies to figure out where micro school too right isn't she small or she bigger no no she can say it's a k maybe with your help and i guess there's been i'd love to understand she is trying to there's an old catholic school that's she has her eye on and it would absolutely give her the ability to get up to four or five hundred kids eventually yeah that's the that's the idea right now again trying to first do like enough enrollment like before designing a model of like is it three hundred or five hundred or how much how many students they can fill and then also trying different levels like if we do transportation if you don't do transportation like all those pieces so trying so working on that so and then the fourth one is in the grand junction rolling fork like that that area but that will be a smaller school compared to the other three what is when you talk about innovative what does that mean so i'll come to that so that this is just like a usual twenty five school plan but like our goal is like at least five to seven like we started with two to three now seeing the pipeline we move to five now we are at five to seven because since like last three months like we have been like either got in touch or like were approached by so we are seeing like a very strong pipeline of innovative schools so now right now like there are four buckets that we have shortlisted or four themes i would say so one i think we had shared about like the the rural micro school networks or like cluster of micro schools within the rural areas and i'll talk more about those the second one is more around career connected industry partnership schools and then the third one is more initially we had this in the same bucket but separated it out based on the models that we are seeing evolving is more of the next gen learning like how integrated ai is and part of not replacing like not the alpha school replication but like more human human in the loop so like the main thesis is that ai is helping the efficiency and there is an ai literacy component for high school students too but like more like not alpha school where we are like two hours a day two hours a day not that model yeah yeah i do i do but again like my biggest open question there is that if i want to say all kids how how much of access it provides to all i think that is where i'm like that needs to be tested so is there like what if the kids have special needs of any kind how does that i mean does that really fit every yeah is it inclusive is it like is the design really inclusive is the question that i'm i mean in theory i think they would say like okay it's only two hours so then you have the opportunity to work like a sped tutor or or some other kind of you know tutor to kind of come in at a different time but i don't know yeah and then also like trying to like again you know like why this is a pilot innovative school area for us is like this might work at forty five thousand dollars fifty thousand dollars a year per student like can it work in seventeen thousand dollars in denver metro is the thing that needs to be proven so that is the third bucket and the fourth bucket is and i would say like this is an area where we haven't done a lot but now realizing after putting together that document we were like hey we named this area but we haven't done so right now have started a couple of pilots there is the dual language bilingual school because when lydia and i worked in texas and like some of the other geographies like a lot of schools provided dual language bilingual and here the hispanic ladino student population or multilingual lingual learners population grew by thirty five percent but not enough models to cater to those needs so that is an intentional bucket for us within it might not be as innovative if i go to texas and say that hey can we get this model here but for here like i think they will have to adapt to the learning styles and like the policies here so so those are the four buckets now what that means is like so in in the rural innovation bucket we have hierarchies i think we have lydia and i shared our thesis about iraq these with you but but like so that was one and then justice and heritage academy in alamosa they are working with csi to submit a charter application now so they run the boces in tonito and they have applied for charter a couple of times and were denied multiple two times other part of the yeah basically yeah yeah yeah so they've been paid by through that both arin and michelle have been taking like significant pay cuts and then during the summer months they have to do other jobs to to make ends meet so so for us like we were like hey this school definitely needs like a more sustainable model so working with them to see if they can get this charter through csi again like authorization is an uphill battle there but that's something we are working on are you guys investing in any policy support for these schools to kind of help them through that process because i do feel like yeah so that ecosystem policy work is different again i'll come to that one is like direct school support and then also like reducing the barriers part is the whole separate area for us so so that is so in the in terms of like these micro schools the way we support is that for example hierarchies got their charter approved for up to two hundred fifteen students so we basically and then they the csp grant they got was also for the whole expansion so we basically said that if you're opening three to four micro sites in park county or beyond like that's what we are supporting so we gave them like a grant for three years to basically expand and serve more students but the goal was like can this first like once we have like milestones for each of those disbursements to make sure that the first site that they are launching is like one we are going there tomorrow so it'll be it'll be good to see how things are happening and i think they are breaking ground on their facility also i think sometime this week so so yeah that that was one and then with justice and heritage academy right now like most of the support is around helping writing their charter petition i just over the weekend i was discussing with them about hey how are we putting the budget together like is it like a single site or similar to hierarchies like doing a cluster because then that limits the csp like if you don't do that so we're trying to figure out like and then balancing it with like what can get through authorizing so so yeah trying to a b test both with with them and then like once they have conversations more with internal are they still working with yeah andrew has been andrew's working and then on the authorization side we are also both authorization and communications because just creating a buzz around them one family support need so working on the communication front we publish few articles or like some stories positive stories out there so that there is a more poll there i think that is something focusing on and then both andrew and craig hatcher he's working on like some of the grass stops grassroot engagements there too because again like even if to get released to csi they will require all this so we are trying to yeah they work with so right now i think for them focus is more on authorization and that was one of the biggest learning was like what we had assumed initially was getting authorized like it's at least five x more difficult or ten x more difficult in some especially in smaller like smaller rural areas because then like there is like one district school which is the main employer of the district and like there's a lot of like pushback from the community so that is that is on the rural so again providing them grant and then all these outside support so for just as a heritage academy connected them today to shannon who was at minga and starting her own work now so to help them like think through the budgeting and like different scenarios because she did with hierarchies so i was like might as well use the same scenario planning to are you guys contracting the school's paying no we probably at least for first two schools we will to see how it works and if it works well then probably extend the because i think like the grant that we have given like a small planning grant that we have given to justice and heritage academy that like it won't cover them yeah like otherwise it will take like probably fifty percent of their capital so probably will do like a broader because there are a couple of other schools and other two buckets also that require this support so we were like okay let's just so on that level we've attracted shannon too and we have a few other people online but i think like part of what cultivated would like to do is to partner with shannon or somebody like shannon to do that modeling for schools before they even like get to the point where they're looking for a charter or whatnot to make sure that it's feasible right and then also utilize again shannon or somebody like shannon to be the back office if you're great yeah i think that is something that's where like when she said like she's starting her own practice i was like okay like let's at least do like two three school pilot with them to see like how it turns out and then trying to also figure out like yeah what role philanthropy needs to play in supporting this and what's the minimum number of students across two three networks that will make it pay for itself kind of so yeah yeah i mean we've started talking to pilot schools and another founders across the state too about you know this back office support and like the cost of you know paying for all these different subscriptions and then but still needing to be able to speak to a person when they're doing budget modeling and everyone is like please yeah and somebody who understands yes and understands like maybe what it's like in this environment to be a full founder because i think initially they were working with like charter writing consultants and they were creating the budget and like more recently authorizers have become very tight around like hey this doesn't work so they require like some financial expertise to your point like ahead of submitting the charter is like is this even viable feasible or not i think we could also i mean i think there's also you know some marketability to the micro micro school but also just independent schools or innovative schools across the state for not just even in startup like okay i'm in year five i need to start scaling down from philanthropic support how like what are the holes you know in my in my budget just being able to kind of that's at least a lot of the founders that i'm talking to are most of them are not start in a startup phase like i think it would be unbelievably beneficial in a startup phase but i also think it would be really beneficial to have that financial assistance and kind of budget modeling and it's a shame that there's not something that exists that's like a score the sba score network for specifically for schools right yeah because to your point again i haven't spoken to as many entrepreneurs as you have but at least like when i was working when i started working with hierarchies and all the questions i used to ask about like hey have you done this scenario that scenario and then no like i'm just trying to and then like there was a lot of like verbal responses to that but i was like how does this quantify into numbers was on but when shannon started working and she started joining these meetings he was like okay let me pull the model and like they were like more concrete scenario planning with csp without csb like all those things like was very very helpful i mean i feel like it would help validate the founders you know and help them feel more prepared and feel more secure and i mean that's half the battle here it's like it's very business alive yeah and it's really hard when you're like you know the marketing person the nurse the educator the staff admin near the every person to then look up and be like okay like let me you know see how the full picture looks and to feel confident and i i mean these are frankly like business owners in addition to school leaders and so important i think the beautiful part about shannon those two too that she has worked with so many schools across the state that she understands the small modeling of them of how how many schools yeah what does that look like if you're trying to grow like hierarchies or staying where you are like i mean justice and heritage academy they want to keep the one sided yeah so that was that was another thing that we were solving for them of like hey they want to continue to run this and they want to open a charter school it required like legal assistance around like hey can this be under the same umbrella of a five one c three does it have to be separate then if it is separate how we do that like just navigating those questions is kind of something that legal assistance is is also required because yeah because like i think for micro school i also think that there are there are untapped funding streams in colorado's statute that need to be tapped in but like how do you navigate that and like work around your structure to be able to secure that depends on your model like student population you're serving and other things but that is another level which is in place but how to untap that is needs to be figured out to your question on the policy side of things on policy side i think those are the two things i have one is authorization piece like is there an easier way for innovative schools to get authorized route because a normal five hundred student charter school spending eggs dollars on getting authorized and have one hundred student three site micro school spending same amount of dollars like doesn't add up so yeah i mean and that's or even if it takes that then funders philanthropy sector needs to understand to to support that need upfront if it is one time if it is ongoing then like that's the different question problem to solve what was the second policy authorization authorization and then this funding like tapping the funding stream because like again fifteen thousand fourteen thousand fifteen thousand ppr including mil levy is still tight so like what other funding streams depending on the student population and all the things that you can tap in yeah to do that i think those are the two right the third theme that i talked about was more around industry partnerships and career connected learning so we have one founder that we supported this year justin scott he led the kip austin region and then moved here last year worked at rocky mountain prep and now starting his own school so this year he's building his model having conversations and will submit the charter application next year is he part of the new legacy or no no he's not so again like with legacy institute or legacy fellowship what we have figured is like more early stage or like first time school leaders like he has run a network so for him like it he requires different types of assistance more around navigating stakeholders versus like how do i run a school leadership development so it was a different support so we directed we directly do the incubation and so he's thinking of a high school nine through twelve so the larger region is to have like multiple industries but starting with aviation and aerospace for now so like there are therapy is going to go into that school sky school maybe not but i mean that that building is not sustainable that's why kill them not sure unless somebody is doing a fire sale and we are getting it achieved i'm ready to so for for that model like again similar to hierarchies like there is an incubation grant for ea zero once they get charter approved we will give like first four years of year zero plus first three years of funding to them startup funding and then also like similar supports like navigating authorization navigating facilities make keen connections so he's this week next week and so for the next three weeks he's visiting all the schools across the nation to to see where industry partnerships or aviation type of students like so we from growth front we had some of this connect so we made with those connections he's now visiting those schools and learning alongside yeah so he basically like he has he has created his thesis or a model now he's validating components of it of like hey what does signature experience nine through twelve look like what is the graduate profile that a student who goes through aviation or aerospace track at a twelve year old who want to be like oh i want to do aviation all my life like you know you never know so like what are the pathways for them and even like if it's not there are marketing courses there are finance courses which are also well in the same industry but can also be replicable to others so like how do we how do we not like box it in like one stream but then also like provide more so he's trying to like learn that from see he's going to davinci schools in la just one of my favorites i would have been a pharmacist that's where i wanted to be yeah but but yeah yeah yeah i think that's what's so hard sometimes about those types of models is like the lack of flexibility yeah so so that is where like i think even like the goal for him is like he he wrote down like seven different graduate profiles of like one like the goal is so i think some of some of the things around like cte models is also like the way people interpret it it is very different like for him it's like goal is to serve multilingual multilingual learners and then also get to more like higher aspiring higher paying jobs within these fields so like making sure that he is preparing kids for that so right now yeah i think again authorization is the biggest piece to solve there but then also modeling and this is going to be an expensive model so how do we figure out a facility solution for that because that's the only level we can figure out how to reduce that so those are the two big steps if somebody is doing fire sale yes i'm i'm up for it we can bank that building for a year do you have the fourth method like the next generation learning yeah so so again we'll be starting the leader search next week for so we are doing a partnership with magic school ai and doing a joint search to support a school for the next year learning again because they're there thesis like we were very aligned with their thesis like we are not replacing the teachers we are basically giving them tools too identify the so we are doing an international search we have hired a recruitment firm to help us do that so it will go out next week but then again it's it's going to be we are open to both like a a unicorn leader who knows the next where tech is heading and responsible ai and also run a school and nose enrollment and how to get students how to make it financially work if not then we probably might have to do like a more of a co founder or executive director school leader model where typically like for smaller schools like having this so trying to trying to figure out who that person and then magic school ai will do a lot of like technical training and like setting up the stuff but yeah so that is that is on the second third bucket and then dual language we just started the work so in roaring folk there is valley settlement sort of like no no choice options for hispanic latino families there so they are now doing like learning work of like should we partner with someone should we open a school the community sessions we did two community sessions there and working with a consultant who is taking them to tour to some of these dual language schools so once they see like hey this is the vision for the model and then we'll support them either through legacy or directly depending on the leader profile so yeah those are the four where again so to your question when we say innovative like this is more around one is like taking more risk and giving more upfront grant ear which we typically don't do for other schools or if they're coming through legacy legacy pays them and we only do something so ear is what we are doing additional and then also realizing some of these are more expensive models so trying to figure out how can we reduce the upfront cost and then all the other supports around authorization facilities on the policy front again this is an area where you will require lot of collective thinking and again with upcoming elections everything is in a flux like you can like nothing will pass right now just kidding so so yeah don't but again like trying to figure out like hey if there is a window of opportunity that opens what are the top ten things or top five things that we want to move forward with one of the things is like is there an easier way for innovative schools to get authorized the thing is like the challenge is like if some of like for example just in school if it is going to csi it basically gets excluded from all the bond money and district space and like other things which basically makes this model unsustainable so for him like the only way is to work with the district to get authorized which is blue charging so is there a is there a state incentive for the districts to to do some of this is what what we need to figure out on the policy side interesting it's interesting i was talking to superintendent on terms school district and they have she's done some innovative stuff with transcend and teacher modeling to make sure that they have more sustainable roles considered unable to hire a lot of the roles because they're so rural they also started the first like outdoor micro school as a district so it's district run it's a forest school like maxes out at one hundred ten kids i believe is that right but she was talking about the fact that they there's been a classical school that's been going for a charter more towards classical yeah they they got approved yeah they did they did get approved was that last week no so they they went for state appeal yeah and stayed basically said yes and sent him back to the district and they approved it i don't think the district did they did but now they are just negotiating the charter contract interesting okay that's new because she basically was like if they don't if they want to get approved and at this point three weeks ago she was saying that they hadn't that it will close some of their district schools and so they didn't have an incentive because the loan is enrolled into justin you know and they're too so the state appeal yeah so so that's how so state approved it state basically sent back to the district which was like you have to approve otherwise release them to csm interesting okay sorry yeah but but yeah to the point like getting every school authorized in the eca environment as well very difficult like there needs to be especially for smaller schools because again when we were doing the hierarchies enrollment study like this is one and a half hour park counties one and a half hour drive like you cannot expect one school in fair play to basically serve the whole county even though like the n size is small but like you're asking a family to drop the kid one in harsh each way with limited transportation like that's not yeah different geographies like again aurora denver denver metro some of the areas have high need but politics is not supportive like depends on that's why i said like this november elections we'll know more yeah agreed then smaller places like it's more of the rural dynamics and like small plays by the district everyone yeah is certainly yeah so biggest employer like you don't like even to get like three k added in one of the schools east inside eastern plains which preschool is not even under district purview but still district basically said that no so so like those are the things where like with i think it's very relational there so how you navigate those grass top relations is is what is needed there so yeah that's the biggest challenge of like again understanding if your district population is six hundred and you're taking fifty plus fifty students also it's like close to ten percent of the students which is tough for them so so there is a financial impact but then where the logic is not working and i'm we are trying to figure out how do we communicate that better is is like for example trinidad in sound forty percent of the students are going to neighborhood districts to attend the school there's a forty percent fourteen forty yeah because there's no good district option there like the logic of like we are bringing students back to the district you are getting five percent whatever management fees like you're getting more revenue this ppr is processed through you like yeah yeah yeah so so that is the that is the argument which or like story or derivative that needs to go is like if if there are like lot of out of yeah out of district definitely are you familiar with them the my tech high they used to be called no they used to be called open end yeah do you know matt bowman he started him and his wife started maitakai in utah and it's like a home school it started as like a homeschool enrichment online kind of program that you could get esa funds like families could use and get funds but they won't have transitioned to open end and what they do is they go from state to state and partner with the districts so that some of the ppr goes back to the district even though the child is not in the classroom in the district so they're basically doing running contracts with districts to offer this as like a service to homeschool families so and they're primarily focusing on states that don't have esas as a means of like trying to get so this was something i again i couldn't wrap my head around they were here but they got politically put yeah not surprising but like there is this micro school initiative or some micro school micro school solutions which takes like ten percent of the ppr to manage more than that yeah something within the boces takes on their sticks their contract okay yeah so i i heard that and i was like i mean we are already talking about financial sustainability challenges and then yeah i think it was around ten fifty right i don't know the exact okay this is your launch pad this is how but what's the service or like what's the supply side right now the only services that they have access to getting them a charter a contract school is the er proceeds go ahead but you get like more higher ppr then you get homeschool he's basically living in the gray of the language of the boces and all the schools that rochelle's taking they're all really exits too we go interesting yeah and they are accountable to the same things a charter would be sequentially so they like they do state testing they have to do this bed services you have to have all the same requirements of hours and then the education re envision boces is you know basically allowing these schools to work as a contract school underneath their education re envision school so these are they're contracting the students out and they're doing it across the state they're doing it with all types of schools and it's basically any you say but but the folks that we're working with have not found benefit outside of it open a door for them to the to just open they're not but we could do that we wouldn't take fifteen percent but the only thing is like as i said like authorization is the biggest challenge and that's probably that's their biggest usps is about the cost like what fifteen twenty percent yeah but most of them now know like they can do this for a year and helps them get launched it helps them get that enrolled in base and ground themselves in the community in which they're working in and then they can go to education re envision proceeds and just say i want to be separated from microschool solutions and so then the er boces only takes six percent which is similar to what a normal district would take for a charter yeah and they still are getting that full period people spending so it works out for them in the end it's just helping them recognize that and then we are been helping them with the financial modeling with that it's like but you never know like if district is going to be right okay with it what's the risk of that it doesn't matter it doesn't matter if they stay under the er boces if they want to become charter eventually then that is like a whole nother way but if they want to stay independent if they want to say yeah so they they only get ppr not the mill name so they will only get the state funding component is it not the main level i think it rounds out to be about nine thousand dollars per student so for most of these micro school founders i think it's eleven isn't it yeah yeah but by the time they get it yeah this twenty percent it's eight thousand dollars per student which for most of these it's helpful i think it's for hierarchies like their mil levies little higher because of there so like the like that's how they are making work which is still like five at least five thousand more than eleven thousand facility it helps yeah yeah so especially once someone helps them get a facility in the first place right in the first place yeah yeah yeah well sudanshu how can we continue to partner i mean i think there's a lot of really amazing energy i want you guys are doing and we're starting to it's really kicking into hind gear for us as well and we love to partner with you so as i said then count for when we were starting this is like the innovative schools pipeline that will emerge so the examples that i shared are much further in their work like there are three at least three others that we are talking to that might be fault twenty eight so they'll start working there so there are six or seven right now what we didn't account for is each school is going to take a lot of work and time both around authorization then facilities yeah exactly i'm the consultants we are working with is also the ad hoc support and that also like project management comes on us is like okay this conversation happened or like did we meet this person or that person like all those things like still we have to keep the track so that is where i'm like and again like for just as an heritage academy i reached out to shannon like if she's already part of like your support network is there an easier way to like just help coordinate that and then i'm happy to think through a solution where like if it's legal assistance or back office assistance or other assistance like you are like you cultivate is the point person and then you bring in like would that be helpful for you so lydia and i are at capacity i'm running behind already on like reaching out to like there are there are there are two emails that i need to send to justice heritage academy so i'm just like so that is where like i think and again it's not right on them like we have committed like hey we will connect you to this person that person but it's so that is where i'm i'm like is if there is a more structured support for them i think again i it's hard to define a support i know like there are themes there are themes i told you like okay financial like charter application they need a financial modeling support so that is just one example but like within that also then like there will be ten things that they need to figure out so so that is where i think what if we figure out like these are the four big areas like authorization finance facilities maybe one or two others even like i think like for justice and heritage academy example like they have been operating it as like a more like they have been running this like they will have to hire somebody to run this alamosa like how do they codify their academics or like what they have been doing their culture like that's their biggest plus so like will it be reflected in alamos or not like helping them think through some of that piece like those are the things that kind like there's a few so those are like five buckets and again we made the connection to greg hatcher to support on the authorization piece but like all the other pieces like individually managing and project managing that all things are moving is difficult so like that is where if we name like these are the five things what schools require and then what are the areas where like you all can support them like then we directly reach out to you versus individual folks like that could be more arditative and then like we can figure out the authorization like that's an area where we are like spending more time but like the other pieces are something which we can figure out how to support the school sounds super comfortable same thing with with justin like even though he's opening a charter schooling but he also requires somebody to write the chart of petition do the do the financials like so again i connected him to sharon but some of these things are like irrespective of the size of the school will remain same he might have a head start or academic codification but like the other things at kip like he used to work with a cfo they had a cfo and like a big finance team so he never went deep into all these nitty gritty live ideas so i understand with you like is there a number of students that you will not go below like when you're thinking about these innovative models like does it have to be a hundred students or more like is there is there flexibility there or are you guys putting kind of a stake in the ground at a particular student population number the answer is i don't know that's fine too one i don't know but then also it depends on the geography as well like this valley settlement school that i talked about like they cannot have more than one hundred students this lamar altavista in lamar like they cannot add more than sixty students there still open to supporting them just thinking again right i don't think you are working know that are all i would say i would say like to do non negotiables for us as one like the student population that they're serving like it has to be or at least either it is providing more access or like serving high free and reduced again it's difficult to kind of like have a very hard number to that like forty percent thirty percent because if i go to another district it will change but like if the school is intentional about like hey the district is thirty percent free and reduced lunch but we are committed to serving fifty that itself is like twenty percent more than the district so we are ok to do that even though it's fifty not sixty seventy eighty like there were schools but we are ok to do that so i'm just thinking about in relation to shannon the reason why i'm asking is i'm just thinking around i guess there way to have the cost go down for everybody including these larger schools that you're working with if she's able to work with you know smaller schools all over the state like is there a balance there for more of that fractional support yeah like is there a way to make it more accessible and price point wise for schools overall i mean if she's working with bigger schools that are in our portfolio and if subsidizes the cost of working with yeah even though if they are not in our schools i think that should be ok that was yeah yeah yeah no again it's hard to find back office providers who are flexible to do both when we were looking for hierarchies everyone said no all the usual names said no so understand that yeah so if she works with two big schools which allows her to do two or three more smaller schools and if there is a philanthropic gap to be filled i think it's it's fine that is part of our like more ecosystem development investments which is fine it just has such a long tail like of support for schools like that kind of yeah it's really i'm curious like what is your board how involved is your board and decision and what is your board ultimately like five years from now on a cfara school is funding as an auto charters is it creating hor school choice like where what does that trigger yeah so when we started last year it was twenty five schools twelve thousand seats so let's see but then we one of our board members pushed if it is that would you be ok with twelve more dsst schools across colorado and we'll be like done and we were like no that is not our impact we want model choice we want somebody to speak we want impact we want like so so then they were like ok then define what five years from now what we would look like and i can share that i don't remember but we created like ok to define our impact it's beyond just twelve thousand seats and twenty five schools because that is like and when we captured that like both lady and i were like yeah if we look at our time like where we are spending most of our time might probably just give us like two thousand seats of those twelve thousand but then like that is where that gives work gives us more energy but like doing the same as shannon model like doing the whole allows us to do that but our board pushed us on explicitly defining that like how many rural schools will be there at the end of five years how many so we couldn't put the number to it but we basically said that like this is how we are defining our impact ok because like because like if like the amount of time we are spending on let's say justice and heritage academy like if i only counted by twelve thousand seats frame like it our board will be like while you're doing but you you you could share that yeah i can i can share that what we created in terms of like broader definition of impact than just seeds now even after defining that the tension that we keep getting is the prioritization especially because of limited capacity like like it's an everyday question for like hey do i do a call with a developer that can help dssd open x school or do i get on that call like that is a tension like we haven't solved that like i don't want to say that by just defining our impact we solved this yeah so what are the other things that you if you think in five years where else are you thinking that you would love to have impact so one one is on so one is like the type of schools and the job like job of models like that is on the school side and on the ecosystem side there are other pieces of like more better facilities ecosystem so like if i have to define a vision for that is what we did in idaho when i was at growth fund because basically when we started the first school that we financed there there were two term sheets that we got and banks were like we cannot give more than sixty five percent loan to value and this is the interest rate take it or leave it and when i left csgf last year the school that we were financing got seventeen term sheets so and this was in and banks were ready to go to up to eighty percent loan to value and much lower interest rate that what cdfi is in idaho in idaho but dealing with the albertsons family foundation this is yeah so so albertsons basically albertsons basically so these are all the created we get a chance to visit so so what they did was basically like they they worked on the policy side of it so there is a revolving loan fund now which basically supports do that there is a role of philanthropy that closes the last five to seven percent of the gap and then the bank like there are more banks so like you can you can negotiate a better rate so so that is my vision for like facilities vision is there yeah how do we create like more options for it's sort of easy we don't have an albertsons here if i'm hearing philanthropy covered the last five to seven percent yeah so i mean that we have already budgeted for through blueprint and other partners that we are supporting but you're going to continue partnering with blueprint yes but like not like this innovative schools i don't think that's their model so that work will still continue but for the regular like academy of arts and knowledge wants to lease to own like that's the model bread and butter for blueprint they can do that and get them i mean it's saving them one hundred fifty thousand dollars per year which is like one and a half fe probably so why not so so those for those models yes and then for these innovative cases we'll have to figure out but the overall goal is still to like even for blueprint to work here like there should be a broader financing ecosystem and then like the part of the other vision is like now schools don't have to go to like hey this is the developer i need to go to this is the lawyer i need to find everything is said like once you decide like this is the building i need like there are things that happen in the process in the process and then the school leader was i i used to be on closing calls for these financing the school leader was used to be on the call but didn't speak a single word everyone was basically like thinking in school's interest and were negotiating with each other and basically like how do we deliver the cheapest solution to the school kind of a dispute so i that is my home but there is an example that how it happened i know how to kind of replicate yeah so so that is the other part of impact beyond schools like some ecosystem pieces how how often do you and lydia talk about ecosystem every day every day you probably authorization and facilities is where we get stuck every time so so yeah like we were in idaho three weeks back we took a developer from colorado springs on a learning trip because idaho has done this i mean even colorado has done this but going out of state probably captures more learning so so we went there and then we had a conversation so charter school and a developer partnership where developer has donated the land and site improvements to the school and then school has basically raised typical financing that has reduced the cost by at least four to five million dollars for so so that partnership structure is something that we wanted this developer to see and you were saying again this is the developer donating the land within the development that they're doing similar to what stead did too right similar but that was a forty like pretty high cost building yeah but like with the development did in fact give the land right that was kind of the whole yeah but i think like different structures in different parts like dsst has some developer partnership with oakwood homes like they there was a different structure stead has a different so there are examples here that we have captured but then with idaho it was like schools are getting sustainable on public dollars on these facilities but it requires i think one interesting thing that we learned there was why developers want to partner with schools charter schools are not district schools because they are required to set a set aside a land the challenge you know idaho that they are facing which here also in some districts should be true is that for new developments it is very difficult to pass a bond so for district to open a school it's a six seven year ten year cycle versus charter school is bringing the market money because like developers like their incentive is to sell homes their homes will not sell if there are no good schools so for them it's like ok we are donating three million dollars worth of land and like site improvements but it is getting us but for district like you are increasing the tax you are increasing xy like that's more load on the buyers so that's how they are kind of viewing it but some developers there were like very intentional i want one district school i want one classical school i want one xyz gem prep type of school so they were thinking more of a portfolio approach and that's why we took this developer of like hey you have a plan for next ten years these many homes can we take that portfolio strategic portfolio approach where you have district school but also two other models that families don't want now they decide like which model so we can figure out but at least have two more options there shouldach but you guys it was really wonderful talking to you yeah let's try to your point list down what are the areas where startup schools need support from like charter petition to authorization like everything and then let's figure out which areas we can build some support into purchasing or getting land at a significant discount from churches or leasing from churches they're just the largest landowner in the united states and i know they're suffering yeah so sunday well even the land that they own to be able to i don't know just to offset because right now i know a lot of them are trying to split and sell land because they can't really afford so i think in colorado there are three two main archdiocese one is everything north of east county line and then one is south of east county line i think and they basically have most of the property the challenge and at least for the north one like their cfo was like yeah we want to get rid of some of the assets that they have but they are more like we want to sell it closer to the market price okay which becomes at least in current denver market is seeing there's a grace presbyterian owns that whole stretch on santa fe between hounds ranch parkway and county line and so when they were doing all the construction on santa fe they leased their land to the construction so that it could live on their land while it was happening but talking with that church specifically they're like no we would like to have something good happen on this land that's not just you know another storefront or something because you know these individual churches care about what's happening and they realize that they can't really sustain all of it and so they need to offload some of that asset and several of the churches that we've least spaced around because they needed the revenue had similar scenarios where they have a large amount of land but they aren't using it and their church is struggling and so they're looking for revenue streams or ways again like very case to case if it's very difficult to get a loan on a leased land so if school is basically like i'll lease it for lease itself from the church but i will have to at least own loan banks are like okay it's very risky unless that lease is like ninety nine years or like whatever that number is but for a short term lease like if it's a five year lease or a ten year lease then they don't want to give it and that is where i think like blueprint can help is like if it's a smaller renovation then we can figure out sources for it and like blueprint has done a lot of leasehold improvements both in in washington and in california so that that is but if it's like a grounds up built on a land it will require fifteen twenty million or even if it's a smaller school it will require compared to their enrollment a significant number that is pretty difficult to finance so yeah i i think again depends on case to case what's the current structure of the like how much are we renovating all those pieces going to the only other thing i would say it is i don't want to view this leader for your next gen learning model but i could sure help with somebody if you don't find the unicorn please share the names as we are looking at those people as somebody who lives in the ai world the tech does all the curricular assessment and has led us okay i just don't want to be the one to lead it but i could support somebody if you don't find a unicorn in those pieces even if you do though i think yeah no i think it's important definitely yeah yeah i build ai tools right now for the curriculum that i wrote and the pieces that i did okay i will definitely we can out of that if you find somebody to support you in that one yeah again like it's a quick turnaround like from leader hire to submit the charter so we are prioritizing more on like putting those pieces but i'm pretty sure we will soon get into like academic model and like all those debates around and again it's a good opportunity to think through all those structures that we have used in education see time all those things but at the same time like make sure that it's like inclusive and accessible like that is the piece so in all the other models we were like okay what is the bed that we are making somebody is running the school and we are basically helping them make it financially so it's more financial or facilities risk here it's also academic less so it's like an academic financial and facilities in it like it's a it's a bigger challenge human centered design if you're familiar with certain horizon framework that getting smart chemo was not my school brain and so looking at ai as how do you support the educators doing the work rather than outsource everything to the ai and so how does it become more of a partnership is where i live when i'm not doing cultivated work so if you're very interested in a bigger chat about that i'd be happy to share kind of my thinking around that and see if it would be helpful for sure this was helpful thank you yeah no again like as i said all learnings probably some of these might be like hey we terribly failed in xyz but at least like some of these bets are like yeah we definitely need to make so yeah again like super helpful to hear your what you are hearing from others pool leaders as well because that kind of helps us inform like how do we build the ecosystem alongside which is again school in of itself cannot now operate and i guess i would just end with like the ecosystem work that i think we're also excited about is how do we push a little bit beyond what our kind of typical schools so that i keep hearing is schools we want to open up more schools we run a lot of seats but i don't actually think that's going to change education just by opening more schools so i guess i'm still very much the i'm going to be the person that pushes on the like so what's innovative about any of the things that were yeah opening or doing because yeah i would say we don't need another dsst you know i mean some neighborhoods might actually geographically i'm just thinking for in order for education to change in my opinion your opinion so don't you like we have to have some things that probably aren't schools actually we just need different educational learning opportunities that look very different so you know so i just i love mister face it's a little bit different so i made a note i will share that broader impact language that that we were i mean work in progress but i'll share that and it's all work in progress and we're going to continue to learn continue to grow and figure it out but in terms of next steps did i also just kind of hear this idea of can cultivated work on what i don't know if the sense of menu of maybe what we could offer areas of where we could support yeah yeah would that be helpful yeah that would be yeah definitely be helpful and then yeah we have some live examples that we all are working on as a starting point okay cool",

long have you been on the age status so I got my wouldn't be approved in 2021 so went through the first three year cycle and got it renewed last year in 2024OKGiven that I am from India and like the wait times are unlimited so yes that's the idea to continue to renewOK I sent you the welcome email we're going to find a link that will take you to our platform where you cannot upload documents directly to our portal and I also do something for the document where we're going to be todayThey are formal links on the bottom of the emailOne question about your education so you have a bachelors degree rightEngineeringYou also have a degree in national Institute of technologyYeah that's my bachelors degree the university of an MBA specialization for an NBAYeahEducation evaluation for the NBA yearI used the service for my H&B application that translated that attend the education evaluation but I was looking at the list that you all have recommended and it was a different provider so I'm not sure but yeah I have done it before and it was an equivalent MBA toDo you thinkIn the MBA and also the education evaluation that you have yeah I can I can send you do you need the hardcopies or the scan copy is goodPerfect so I have the scanned copies that I can uploadUpYeah OK I'll do that OK because you have masters in MB to prove for experience is necessary for the vacation however the more experience improve the stronger your kids becomes under the national interest waiver bro OK so any work certificate that you had any workAny offer letters but you cannot detailed letters employment verification letters I included one for one for your reference and it's under the abbreviation WELOK ideally I'd like to use those letters with more details so US can connect your experience with your endeavorGot itSo far so I just looked at that format so for my like all the work experience that I had in India which is close to like eight years that I already have like work experience certificates from them again I use the same ones for HNB and then my last employer hereWhere I worked for close to six years I can get a similar certificate from themSo like youDouble check your city to make sure all the information that you shared is complete and up-to-date the TV is going to be our checklist when we are putting your keys together we use the reference OKI want to discuss with you about your endeavor endeavors a project that you want to develop in the US they will bring the benefit to the country OK endeavor must be something that you are ready for me and you have an expert teasingEndeavor must be related directly your education in your work experience so what day would like to bring to the tableI also wanted to discuss last year when I switched the job it was to launch this new fund in Colorado along with the CEO and the partner who launched this firmWe have raised $50 million to invest in education organizations here US a goal is to support the growth of charter schools across Colorado which is similar to the work that I did for six years but now only focused on Colorado so within within like that within that work I lead in innovation schools strategy and then rural micro school expansion strategySo so we basically our goal over five years is to support 25 charter schools that are serving low income families and historical under our students in ColoradoWithin that 25 schools our goal is to at least have five Hallmark schools innovative schools that will basically be national exam large and then other states can come and learn from these models and then replicate in their states so these innovation innovative schools are across three buckets one is next general learningSo integrating artificial intelligence into their core model to support teachers improve their efficiency so we are working on two models right now to schools supporting them to launch next in fall of 2027 so so that is one strategy the second one is more career connected learning so supporting schools that will be having industry partnerships and working with high school students to have like a clear career pathways and then the third one is more around dual language schools so Colorado has seen significant growth in Latino Hispanic student PopulationOver the last five years so we want to be intentional about like having charter schools that are providing to a language support to support the growth and learning of those students so those are the three buckets that are under the innovation strategy and then that other piece is the rural education strategy that I'm leading so we like a lot of mountain and rural areas here in Colorado outside of the front rangeDon't have a lot of school choice options there is just one district schools and the performance of those district schools very depending on district district so we are basically supporting school leaders to open micro schools in these regions to serve the student population there again micro schools have been around in the United States but none of them have operated under the public framework like a lot of these are independent private schoolsThat charged like $40,000 to families we are trying to support the leaders who can basically offer a free public schools in these rural areas those are two strategies that I lead which I highlighted in my as well so that's my proposed end of like we are in the second year of the fund now but we will be continuing that workSo we just need to put into words to describe that is the proposed endeavor guidance so you're just going to prepare a draft OK it's not gonna be final we are gonna take care of the final draft and strategy for youWe just need to write down what you have in mind OK what you really wanna do why because no one better than us know what they do best because they will be looking at the experienceRecommendation that we were going to explain next must be part of a puzzle we need to put the pieces togetherOK because the foundation of the keys do you think it's possible for us to send a first draft by Monday this MondayWhen you say the firstOne clarification question I had to I will be already have the business plan for this fund that we have launched so but like it's it's the business plan and that's how we raised money from the philanthropic organizations but like that that fun is basically or like the business plan is basically like what as an organization I want to do but I'm guessing as the proposed endeavor I need to focus on like what would be my role and activities is that correctOK yeah showingThat's the plan which is if you're going to open a business with a business plan is to describe exactly how you're going to carry out you OK so but you already organization this was launched last year we already have the funds raised and I've already supported around 11 schools right now do you think you canYeah I can I can share the business plan and then I can create a separate one page with it which basically focuses on my role and my activities so it's clear that it's not the organization versus like what immigration wants to seeOKRecommendationFrom the fieldSo the higher highest the position the better we asked for at least three letters of recommendation and at least one should come from where we go in independent source someone would have worked the record with you but his knowledge of your accomplishmentsIs someone unbiasedSo when you say independentThat I have not worked with beforeSo like can it be like one of the school leaders that like I don't directly work with them but we have invested or like supported them through a grant like yesWould that be would that be counter as as independent or because he has to work directly with you so they were not part of our organization this is somebody who we have supported because I was thinking of at least getting two or three letters from either the schools that we have supported so these are the CEOs of those networksOr we were talking about or I was thinking of getting some of the ecosystem partners including district officials to get a letter so that I canYeah those would probably be counted as independent because they're not part of the organizationWe also needYou don't have to draft the letters we draft the letter for them and you just have to complete one question for recommender OK where you need to work publishment project you have participating how your role was important to the project so we need to don't be bothered with the letters or recommendation we need to beOne point we need we need to highlight your your skills in how exceptional you are and what you doOKHow much impact does it create based on the profile of the recommenderYeah the higher the higher up and the more position like higher positions they are like the better right OKOK so like what would I need from those recommenders like do so when is the letter that basically highlights the projects that I worked with them on and my contribution and black party OK OKOK and then you said we will also require their CV to be attachedOKOKSo do you have any kids now no I have I have one kid and he is a US citizen so should be here so are you thinking about a processing yes that's because again my H1B is valid till July 2027So ideally againYeah I think that would be better because then at least we'll hear back soonerIn case I would recommend processing because you wanna know what's gonna happen you know when you need to extend your stay hereI have to agree with you that timeline we don't need to file strong in solid caseWorried about timeline because of the situation with visibility and also because of the issues that is going on right now we don't want you to be affected by anyIncrease in the filing fee OK or by any craziness that may be going on eventually so two months is what we need to file a case we don't need one in two months OKSacrifice and quality of the documentThat was one of the questions like two questions I had related to that one wasOne was yeah I think given like the recent H1B changes again based on what I've learned and the lawyers who filed my HNB like they said that currently based on the language it doesn't impact trends but you never know for what changes in future because it's changing every every monthBut for now like given like so if I get this HB like this if this gets approved and if I file for my H one B renewal like would that have an impact based on the current understandingVery satisfied in United States pretty much is only the first applicants first applicant and it's more when it comes to visa abroad OK we are gonna know we're gonna have some clarifications on that in the next three months OKYeah and then the second question was that yeah I think even I'm targeting to file itBy like January 1 week alsoBut because but like I'll be traveling to India later this month and will be will be back by end of the year so will be back around December 30 so so I know like today's October so if we say two months it will be end of December so yeah around January 1 week is when I was also hoping to like once I'm back like we can file so that my H&B status everything is updated I 94 and everythingDo you have a ball I'll have to get a stamp I have the 797 approved which I need to get the stampingIn your journey get invited to go get this the last week of stamps that got approved in India nobody was asked additional fees so both my attorney and then my wife who works with at Amazon she also need to get stamps for both her lawyers have approved like said like we can visit and get the stamp done this new fee should not apply to usOK three weeks from today we would like to have a follow up meeting with you just as the progress that we have made on the case we're gonna be in contact instantly emails within 24 hours on the weekend any questions and any issues please please contact us and make sure you copy the three of us so we can be on the same pageAnd I'm gonna be sending a post an email with all the documents that we need for the first stage in the second stage of the document collection yeah but just to recap like one of theLike the most urgent ones are like I need to send the transcripts and that equivalent like education equivalent certificate and then the second one is the proposed endeavor and updated just double check my CV for everythingEmail shortly so the employment letter is the most recent one like that might take like a week or so at leastOK perfect can do thatIf you have any just make sure it's completed up-to-date if you have received any prize or you have been invited to be anything that you know you can eat you it's applicable to you but it's starting the city important to add and send us the evidence because those things always highlight more yeahBut don't like what I shared about my profile and if you got a chance to look at the CV as I'm putting together the proposed end and like thisWhat would you consider like the strongest elements that I should focus on and thenOKI like to work with you but we get a little at least oneA little interest interest based institution or organization in endeavorSo we already have received grant funding so we have the grant letter from all the funds we have given us the money so so that I can that I can share yeah OKYeah because I think we have commitment for around $40 million so $42 million so far so we have the grant agreements for those that I can attachYeah because I remember like even for my HNB they had asked because we were just setting up the organization so they had asked us toTo give the grant agreement because they will no tax returns file so in the first yearYou have taken steps in Puerto Rico OKIn the United States so that makes all the difference that's why the plan in the business plan send to us statement you need to make sure that you literallyIndicate every single step inference of your endeavor that you've taken so far OK OK the current status of software things are OKAnything elseWe will need the right visaThe approvalRight nowAnd you're from the visa so I can hold dolphin but I can send the 797 approval notice thatOKI think I asked about the interestLetter of recommendation we talked aboutAnd then timeline also we have spoken so yeah I think I think because also I'll be in India and I'll be not working for a bit I will have capacity to to prepare all the documentation and remove the documentWe're gonna set up the next meeting and we're gonna send the invitation shortly OK and I'll be waiting for the documents and I'm gonna send you my post to be an email in a couple minutes OK perfect that sounds greatOK nice meeting you let's get it sorted yeah yeah thank you so much thank you thank you And I'm going to be working with Michelle in out of the office but you were eventually gonna meet her it's going to be the guys working togetherSounds good United

this was launched last year we already have the funds raised and I've already supported around 11 schools right now do you think you canYeah I can I can share the business plan and then I can create a separate one page with it which basically focuses on my role and my activities so it's clear that it's not the organization versus like what immigration wants to seeOKRecommendationFrom the fieldSo the higher highest the position the better we asked for at least three letters of recommendation and at least one should come from where we go in independent source someone would have worked the record with you but his knowledge of your accomplishmentsIs someone unbiasedSo when you say independentThat I have not worked with beforeSo like can it be like one of the school leaders that like I don't directly work with them but we have invested or like supported them through a grant like yesWould that be would that be counter as as independent or because he has to work directly with you so they were not part of our organization this is somebody who we have supported because I was thinking of at least getting two or three letters from either the schools that we have supported so these are the CEOs of those networksOr we were talking about or I was thinking of getting some of the ecosystem partners including district officials to get a letter so that I canYeah those would probably be counted as independent because they're not part of the organizationWe also needYou don't have to draft the letters we draft the letter for them and you just have to complete one question for recommender OK where you need to work publishment project you have participating how your role was important to the project so we need to don't be bothered with the letters or recommendation we need to beOne point we need we need to highlight your your skills in how exceptional you are and what you doOKHow much impact does it create based on the profile of the recommenderYeah the higher the higher up and the more position like higher positions they are like the better right OKOK so like what would I need from those recommenders like do so when is the letter that basically highlights the projects that I worked with them on and my contribution and black party OK OKOK and then you said we will also require their CV to be attachedOKOKSo do you have any kids now no I have I have one kid and he is a US citizen so should be here so are you thinking about a processing yes that's because again my H1B is valid till July 2027So ideally againYeah I think that would be better because then at least we'll hear back soonerIn case I would recommend processing because you wanna know what's gonna happen you know when you need to extend your stay hereI have to agree with you that timeline we don't need to file strong in solid caseWorried about timeline because of the situation with visibility and also because of the issues that is going on right now we don't want you to be affected by anyIncrease in the filing fee OK or by any craziness that may be going on eventually so two months is what we need to file a case we don't need one in two months OKSacrifice and quality of the documentThat was one of the questions like two questions I had related to that one wasOne was yeah I think given like the recent H1B changes again based on what I've learned and the lawyers who filed my HNB like they said that currently based on the language it doesn't impact trends but you never know for what changes in future because it's changing every every monthBut for now like given like so if I get this HB like this if this gets approved and if I file for my H one B renewal like would that have an impact based on the current understandingVery satisfied in United States pretty much is only the first applicants first applicant and it's more when it comes to visa abroad OK we are gonna know we're gonna have some clarifications on that in the next three months OKYeah and then the second question was that yeah I think even I'm targeting to file itBy like January 1 week alsoBut because but like I'll be traveling to India later this month and will be will be back by end of the year so will be back around December 30 so so I know like today's October so if we say two months it will be end of December so yeah around January 1 week is when I was also hoping to like once I'm back like we can file so that my H&B status everything is updated I 94 and everythingDo you have a ball I'll have to get a stamp I have the 797 approved which I need to get the stampingIn your journey get invited to go get this the last week of stamps that got approved in India nobody was asked additional fees so both my attorney and then my wife who works with at Amazon she also need to get stamps for both her lawyers have approved like said like we can visit and get the stamp done this new fee should not apply to usOK three weeks from today we would like to have a follow up meeting with you just as the progress that we have made on the case we're gonna be in contact instantly emails within 24 hours on the weekend any questions and any issues please please contact us and make sure you copy the three of us so we can be on the same pageAnd I'm gonna be sending a post an email with all the documents that we need for the first stage in the second stage of the document collection yeah but just to recap like one of theLike the most urgent ones are like I need to send the transcripts and that equivalent like education equivalent certificate and then the second one is the proposed endeavor and updated just double check my CV for everythingEmail shortly so the employment letter is the most recent one like that might take like a week or so at leastOK perfect can do thatIf you have any just make sure it's completed up-to-date if you have received any prize or you have been invited to be anything that you know you can eat you it's applicable to you but it's starting the city important to add and send us the evidence because those things always highlight more yeahBut don't like what I shared about my profile and if you got a chance to look at the CV as I'm putting together the proposed end and like thisWhat would you consider like the strongest elements that I should focus on and thenOKI like to work with you but we get a little at least oneA little interest interest based institution or organization in endeavorSo we already have received grant funding so we have the grant letter from all the funds we have given us the money so so that I can that I can share yeah OKYeah because I think we have commitment for around $40 million so $42 million so far so we have the grant agreements for those that I can attachYeah because I remember like even for my HNB they had asked because we were just setting up the organization so they had asked us toTo give the grant agreement because they will no tax returns file so in the first yearYou have taken steps in Puerto Rico OKIn the United States so that makes all the difference that's why the plan in the business plan send to us statement you need to make sure that you literallyIndicate every single step inference of your endeavor that you've taken so far OK OK the current status of software things are OKAnything elseWe will need the right visaThe approvalRight nowAnd you're from the visa so I can hold dolphin but I can send the 797 approval notice thatOKI think I asked about the interestLetter of recommendation we talked aboutAnd then timeline also we have spoken so yeah I think I think because also I'll be in

OK and I'll be waiting for the documents and I'm gonna send you my post to be an email in a couple minutes OK perfect that sounds great And I'm going to be working with Michelle in out of the office

through the first three year cycle and got it renewed last year in 2024OKGiven that I am from India and like the wait times are unlimited so yes that's the idea to continue to renewOK I sent you the welcome email we're going to find a link that will take you to our platform where you cannot upload documents directly to our portal and I also do something for the document where we're going to be todayThey are formal links on the bottom of the emailOne question about your education so you have a bachelors degree rightEngineeringYou also have a degree in national Institute of technologyYeah that's my bachelors degree the university of an MBA specialization for an NBAYeahEducation evaluation for the NBA yearI used the service for my H&B application that translated that attend the education evaluation but I was looking at the list that you all have recommended and it was a different provider so I'm not sure but yeah I have done it before and it was an equivalent MBA toDo you thinkIn the MBA and also the education evaluation that you have yeah I can I can send you do you need the hardcopies or the scan copy is goodPerfect so I have the scanned copies that I can uploadUpYeah OK I'll do that OK because you have masters in MB to prove for experience is necessary for the vacation however the more experience improve the stronger your kids becomes under the national interest waiver bro OK so any work certificate that you had any workAny offer letters but you cannot detailed letters employment verification letters I included one for one for your reference and it's under the abbreviation WELOK ideally I'd like to use those letters with more details so US can connect your experience with your endeavorGot itSo far so I just looked at that format so for my like all the work experience that I had in India which is close to like eight years that I already have like work experience certificates from them again I use the same ones for HNB and then my last employer hereWhere I worked for close to six years I can get a similar certificate from themSo like youDouble check your city to make sure all the information that you shared is complete and up-to-date the TV is going to be our checklist when we are putting your keys together we use the reference OKI want to discuss with you about your endeavor endeavors a project that you want to develop in the US they will bring the benefit to the country OK endeavor must be something that you are ready for me and you have an expert teasingEndeavor must be related directly your education in your work experience so what day would like to bring to the tableI also wanted to discuss last year when I switched the job it was to launch this new fund in Colorado along with the CEO and the partner who launched this firmWe have raised $50 million to invest in education organizations here US a goal is to support the growth of charter schools across Colorado which is similar to the work that I did for six years but now only focused on Colorado so within within like that within that work I lead in innovation schools strategy and then rural micro school expansion strategySo so we basically our goal over five years is to support 25 charter schools that are serving low income families and historical under our students in ColoradoWithin that 25 schools our goal is to at least have five Hallmark schools innovative schools that will basically be national exam large and then other states can come and learn from these models and then replicate in their states so these innovation innovative schools are across three buckets one is next general learningSo integrating artificial intelligence into their core model to support teachers improve their efficiency so we are working on two models right now to schools supporting them to launch next in fall of 2027 so so that is one strategy the second one is more career connected learning so supporting schools that will be having industry partnerships and working with high school students to have like a clear career pathways and then the third one is more around dual language schools so Colorado has seen significant growth in Latino Hispanic student PopulationOver the last five years so we want to be intentional about like having charter schools that are providing to a language support to support the growth and learning of those students so those are the three buckets that are under the innovation strategy and then that other piece is the rural education strategy that I'm leading so we like a lot of mountain and rural areas here in Colorado outside of the front rangeDon't have a lot of school choice options there is just one district schools and the performance of those district schools very depending on district district so we are basically supporting school leaders to open micro schools in these regions to serve the student population there again micro schools have been around in the United States but none of them have operated under the public framework like a lot of these are independent private schoolsThat charged like $40,000 to families we are trying to support the leaders who can basically offer a free public schools in these rural areas those are two strategies that I lead which I highlighted in my as well so that's my proposed end of like we are in the second year of the fund now but we will be continuing that workSo we just need to put into words to describe that is the proposed endeavor guidance so you're just going to prepare a draft OK it's not gonna be final we are gonna take care of the final draft and strategy for youWe just need to write down what you have in mind OK what you really wanna do why because no one better than us know what they do best because they will be looking at the experienceRecommendation that we were going to explain next must be part of a puzzle we need to put the pieces togetherOK because the foundation of the keys do you think it's possible for us to send a first draft by Monday this MondayWhen you say the firstOne clarification question I had to I will be already have the business plan for this fund that we have launched so but like it's it's the business plan and that's how we raised money from the philanthropic organizations but like that that fun is basically or like the business plan is basically like what as an organization I want to do but I'm guessing as the proposed endeavor I need to focus on like what would be my role and activities is that correctOK yeah showingThat's the plan which is if you're going to open a business with a

letters employment verification letters I included one for one for your reference and it's under the abbreviation WELOK ideally I'd like to use those letters with more details so US can connect your experience with your endeavorGot itSo far so I just looked at that format so for my like all the work experience that I had in India which is close to like eight years that I already have like work experience certificates from them again I use the same ones for HNB and then my last employer hereWhere I worked for close to six years I can get a similar certificate from themSo like youDouble check your city to make sure all the information that you shared is complete and up-to-date the TV is going to be our checklist when we are putting your keys together we use the reference OKI want to discuss with you about your endeavor endeavors a project that you want to develop in the US they will bring the benefit to the country OK endeavor must be something that you are ready for me and you have an expert teasingEndeavor must be related directly your education in your work experience so what day would like to bring to the tableI also wanted to discuss last year when I switched the job it was to launch this new fund in Colorado along with the CEO and the partner who launched this firmWe have raised $50 million to invest in education organizations here US a goal is to support the growth of charter schools across Colorado which is similar to the work that I did for six years but now only focused on Colorado so within within like that within that work I lead in innovation schools strategy and then rural micro school expansion strategySo so we basically our goal over five years is to support 25 charter schools that are serving low income families and historical under our students in ColoradoWithin that 25 schools our goal is to at least have five Hallmark schools innovative schools that will basically be national exam large and then other states can come and learn from these models and then replicate in their states so these innovation innovative schools are across three buckets one is next general learningSo integrating artificial intelligence into their core model to support teachers improve their efficiency so we are working on two models right now to schools supporting them to launch next in fall of 2027 so so that is one strategy the second one is more career connected learning so supporting schools that will be having industry partnerships and working with high school students to have like a clear career pathways and then the third one is more around dual language schools so Colorado has seen significant growth in Latino Hispanic student PopulationOver the last five years so we want to be intentional about like having charter schools that are providing to a language support to support the growth and learning of those students so those are the three buckets that are under the innovation strategy and then that other piece is the rural education strategy that I'm leading so we like a lot of mountain and rural areas here in Colorado outside of the front rangeDon't have a lot of school choice options there is just one district schools and the performance of those district schools very depending on district district so we are basically supporting school leaders to open micro schools in these regions to serve the student population there again micro schools have been around in the United States but none of them have operated under the public framework like a lot of these are independent private schoolsThat charged like $40,000 to families we are trying to support the leaders who can basically offer a free public schools in these rural areas those are two strategies that I lead which I highlighted in my as well so that's my proposed end of like we are in the second year of the fund now but we will be continuing that workSo we just need to put into words to describe that is the proposed endeavor guidance so you're just going to prepare a draft OK it's not gonna be final we are gonna take care of the final draft and strategy for youWe just need to write down what you have in mind OK what you really wanna do why because no one better than us know what they do best because they will be looking at the experienceRecommendation that we were going to explain next must be part of a puzzle we need to put the pieces togetherOK because the foundation of the keys do you think it's possible for us to send a first draft by Monday this MondayWhen you say the firstOne clarification question I had to I will be already have the business plan for this fund that we have launched so but like it's it's the business plan and that's how we raised money from the philanthropic organizations but like that that fun is basically or like the business plan is basically like what as an organization I want to do but I'm guessing as the proposed endeavor I need to focus on like what would be my role and activities is that correctOK yeah showingThat's the plan which is if you're going to open a business with a business plan is to describe exactly how you're going to carry out you OK so but you already organization this was launched last year we already have the funds raised and I've already supported around 11 schools right now do you think you canYeah I can I can share the business plan and then I can create a separate one page with it which basically focuses on my role and my activities so it's clear that it's not the organization versus like what immigration wants to seeOKRecommendationFrom the fieldSo the higher highest the position the better we asked for at least three letters of recommendation and at least one should come from where we go in independent source someone would have worked the record with you but his knowledge of your accomplishmentsIs someone unbiasedSo when you say independentThat I have not worked with beforeSo like can it be like one of the school leaders that like I don't directly work with them but we have invested or like supported them through a grant like yesWould that be would that be counter as as independent or because he has to work directly with you so they were not part of our organization this is somebody who we have supported because I was thinking of at least getting two or three letters from either the schools that we have supported so these are the CEOs of those networksOr we were talking about or I was thinking of getting some of the ecosystem partners including district officials to get a letter so that I canYeah those would probably be counted as independent because they're not part of the organizationWe also needYou don't have to draft the letters we draft the letter for them and you just have to complete one question for recommender OK where you need to work publishment project you have participating how your role was important to the project so we need to don't be bothered with the letters or recommendation we need to beOne point we need we need to highlight your your skills in how exceptional you are and what you doOKHow much impact does it create based on the profile of the recommenderYeah the higher the higher up and the more position like higher positions they are like the better right OKOK so like what would I need from those recommenders like do so when is the letter that basically highlights the projects that I worked with them on and my contribution and black party OK OKOK and then you said we will also require their CV to be attachedOKOKSo do you have any kids now no I have I have one kid and he is a US citizen so should be here so are you thinking about a processing yes that's because again my H1B is valid till July 2027So ideally againYeah I think that would be better because then at least we'll hear back soonerIn case I would recommend processing because you wanna know what's gonna happen you know when you need to extend your stay hereI have to agree with you that timeline we don't need to file strong in solid caseWorried about timeline because of the situation with visibility and also because of the issues that is going on right now we don't want you to be affected by anyIncrease in the filing fee OK or by any craziness that may be going on eventually so two months is what we need to file a case we don't need one in two months OKSacrifice and quality of the documentThat was one of the questions like two questions I had related to that one wasOne was yeah I think given like the recent H1B changes again based on what I've learned and the lawyers who filed my HNB like they said that currently based on the language it doesn't impact trends but you never know for what changes in future because it's changing every every monthBut for now like given like so if I get this HB like this if this gets approved and if I file for my H one B renewal like would that have an impact based on the current understandingVery satisfied in United States pretty much is only the first applicants first applicant and it's more when it comes to visa abroad OK we are gonna know we're gonna have some clarifications on that in the next three months OKYeah and then the second question was that yeah I think even I'm targeting to file itBy like January 1 week alsoBut because but like I'll be traveling to India later this month and will be will be back by end of the year so will be back around December 30 so so I know like today's October so if we say two months it will be end of December so yeah around January 1 week is when I was also hoping to like once I'm back like we can file so that my H&B status everything is updated I 94 and everythingDo you have a ball I'll have to get a stamp I have the 797 approved which I need to get the stampingIn your journey get invited to go get this the last week of stamps that got approved in India nobody was asked additional fees so both my attorney and then my wife who works with at Amazon she also need to get stamps for both her lawyers have approved like said like we can visit and get the stamp done this new fee should not apply to usOK three weeks from today we would like to have a follow up meeting with you

StatesRightHow long have you been on the age status so I got my wouldn't be approved in 2021 so went through the first three year cycle and got it renewed last year in 2024OKGiven that I am from India and like the wait times are unlimited so yes that's the idea to continue to renewOK I sent you the welcome email we're going to find a link that will take you to our platform where you cannot upload documents directly to our portal and I also do something for the document where we're going to be todayThey are formal links on the bottom of the emailOne question about your education so you have a bachelors degree rightEngineeringYou also have a degree in national Institute of technologyYeah that's my bachelors degree the university of an MBA specialization for an NBAYeahEducation evaluation for the NBA yearI used the service for my H&B application that translated that attend the education evaluation but I was looking at the list that you all have recommended and it was a different provider so I'm not sure but yeah I have done it before and it was an equivalent MBA toDo you thinkIn the MBA and also the education evaluation that you have yeah I can I can send you do you need the hardcopies or the scan copy is goodPerfect so I have the scanned copies that I can uploadUpYeah OK I'll do that OK because you have masters in MB to prove for experience is necessary for the vacation however the more experience improve the stronger your kids becomes under the national interest waiver bro OK so any work certificate that you had any workAny offer letters but you cannot detailed letters employment verification letters I included one for one for your reference and it's under the abbreviation WELOK ideally I'd like to use those letters with more details so US can connect your experience with your endeavorGot itSo far so I just looked at that format so for my like all the work experience that I had in India which is close to like eight years that I already have like work experience certificates from them again I use the same ones for HNB and then my last employer hereWhere I worked for close to six years I can get a similar certificate from themSo like youDouble check your city to make sure all the information that you shared is complete and up-to-date the TV is going to be our checklist when we are putting your keys together we use the reference OKI want to discuss with you about your endeavor endeavors a project that you want to develop in the US they will bring the benefit to the country OK endeavor must be something that you are ready for me and you have an expert teasingEndeavor must be related directly your education in your work experience so what day would like to bring to the tableI also wanted to discuss last year when I switched the job it was to launch this new fund in Colorado along with the CEO and the partner who launched this firmWe have raised $50 million to invest in education organizations here US a goal is to support the growth of charter schools across Colorado which is similar to the work that I did for six years but now only focused on Colorado so within within like that within that work I lead in innovation schools strategy and then rural micro school expansion strategySo so we basically our goal over five years is to support 25 charter schools that are serving low income families and historical under our students in ColoradoWithin that 25 schools our goal is to at least have five Hallmark schools innovative schools that will basically be national exam large and then other states can come and learn from these models and then replicate in their states so these innovation innovative schools are across three buckets one is next general learningSo integrating artificial intelligence into their core model to support teachers improve their efficiency so we are working on two models right now to schools supporting them to launch next in fall of 2027 so so that is one strategy the second one is more career connected learning so supporting schools that will be having industry partnerships and working with high school students to have like a clear career pathways and then the third one is more around dual language schools so Colorado has seen significant growth in Latino Hispanic student PopulationOver the last five years so we want to be intentional about like having charter schools that are providing to a language support to support the growth and learning of those students so those are the three buckets that are under the innovation strategy and then that other piece is the rural education strategy that I'm leading so we like a lot of mountain and rural areas here in Colorado outside of the front rangeDon't have a lot of school choice options there is just one district schools and the performance of those district schools very depending on district district so we are basically supporting school leaders to open micro schools in these regions to serve the student population there again micro schools have been around in the United States but none of them have operated under the public framework like a lot of these are independent private schoolsThat charged like $40,000 to families we are trying to support the leaders who can basically offer a free public schools in these rural areas those are two strategies that I lead which I highlighted in my as well so that's my proposed end of like we are in the second year of the fund now but we will be continuing that workSo we just need to put into words to describe that is the proposed endeavor guidance so you're just going to prepare a draft OK it's not gonna be final we are gonna take care of the final draft and strategy for youWe just need to write down what you have in mind OK what you really wanna do why because no one better than us know what they do best because they will be looking at the experienceRecommendation that we were going to explain next must be part of a puzzle we need to put the pieces togetherOK because the foundation of the keys do you think it's possible for us to send a first draft by Monday this MondayWhen you say the firstOne clarification question I had to I will be already have the business plan for this fund that we have launched so but like it's it's the business plan and that's how we raised money from the philanthropic organizations but like that that fun is basically or like the business plan is basically like what as an organization I want to do but I'm guessing as the proposed endeavor I need to focus on like what would be my role and activities is that correctOK yeah showingThat's the plan which is if you're going to open a business with a business plan is to describe exactly how you're going to carry out you OK so but you already organization this was launched last year we already have the funds raised and I've already supported around 11 schools right now do you think you canYeah I can I can share the business plan and then I can create a separate one page with it which basically focuses on my role and my activities so it's clear that it's not the organization versus like what immigration wants to seeOKRecommendationFrom the fieldSo the higher highest the position the better we asked for at least three letters of recommendation and at least one should come from where we go in independent source someone would have worked the record with you but his knowledge of your accomplishmentsIs someone unbiasedSo when you say independentThat I have not worked with beforeSo like can it be like one of the school leaders that like I don't directly work with them but we have invested or like supported them through a grant like yesWould that be would that be counter as as independent or because he has to work directly with you so they were not part of our organization this is somebody who we have supported because I was thinking of at least getting two or three letters from either the schools that we have supported so these are the CEOs of those networksOr we were talking about or I was thinking of getting some of the ecosystem partners including district officials to get a letter so that I canYeah those would probably be counted as independent because they're not part of the organizationWe also needYou don't have to draft the letters we draft the letter for them and you just have to complete one question for recommender OK where you need to work publishment project you have participating how your role was important to the project so we need to don't be bothered with the letters or recommendation we need to beOne point we need we need to highlight your your skills in how exceptional you are and what you doOKHow much impact does it create based on the profile of the recommenderYeah the higher the higher up and the more position like higher positions they are like the better right OKOK so like what would I need from those recommenders like do so when is the letter that basically highlights the projects that I worked with them on and my contribution and black party OK OKOK and then you said we will also require their CV to be attachedOKOKSo do you have any kids now no I have I have one kid and he is a US citizen so should be here so are you thinking about a processing yes that's because again my H1B is valid till July 2027So ideally againYeah I think that would be better because then at least we'll hear back soonerIn case I would recommend processing because you wanna know what's gonna happen you know when you need to extend your stay hereI have to agree with you that timeline we don't need to file strong in solid caseWorried about timeline because of the situation with visibility and also because of the issues that is going on right now we don't want you to be affected by anyIncrease in the filing fee OK or by any craziness that may be going on eventually so two months is what we need to file a case we don't need one in two months OKSacrifice and quality of the documentThat was one of the questions like two questions I had related to that one wasOne was yeah I think given like the recent H1B changes again based on what I've learned and the lawyers who filed my HNB like they said that currently based on the language it doesn't impact trends but you never know for what changes in future because it's changing every every monthBut for now like given like so if I get this HB like this if this gets approved and if I file for my H one B renewal like would that have an impact based on the current understandingVery satisfied in United States pretty much is only the first applicants first applicant and it's more when it comes to visa abroad OK we are gonna know we're gonna have some clarifications on that in the next three months OKYeah and then the second question was that yeah I think even I'm targeting to file itBy like January 1 week alsoBut because but like I'll be traveling to India later this month and will be will be back by end of the year so will be back around December 30 so so I know like today's October so if we say two months it will be end of December so yeah around January 1 week is when I was also hoping to like once I'm back like we can file so that my H&B status everything is updated I 94 and everythingDo you have a ball I'll have to get a stamp I have the 797 approved which I need to get the stampingIn your journey get invited to go get this the last week of stamps that got approved in India nobody was asked additional fees so both my attorney and then my wife who works with at Amazon she also need to get stamps for both her lawyers have approved like said like we can visit and get the stamp done this new fee should not apply to usOK three weeks from today we would like to have a follow up meeting with you just as the progress that we have made on the case we're gonna be in contact instantly emails within 24 hours on the weekend any questions and any issues please please contact us and make sure you copy the three of us so we can be on the same pageAnd I'm gonna be sending a post an email with all the documents that we need for the first stage in the second stage of the document collection yeah but just to recap like one of theLike the most urgent ones are like I need to send the transcripts and that equivalent like education equivalent certificate and then the second one is the proposed endeavor and updated just double check my CV for everythingEmail shortly so the employment letter is the most recent one like that might take like a week or so at leastOK perfect can do thatIf you have any just make sure it's completed up-to-date if you have received any prize or you have been invited to be anything that you know you can eat you it's applicable to you but it's starting the city important to add and send us the evidence because those things always highlight more yeahBut don't like what I shared about my profile and if you got a chance to look at the CV as I'm putting together the proposed end and like thisWhat would you consider like the strongest elements that I should focus on and thenOKI like to work with you but we get a little at least oneA little interest interest based institution or organization in endeavorSo we already have received grant funding so we have the grant letter from all the funds we have given us the money so so that I can that I can share yeah OKYeah because I think we have commitment for around $40 million so $42 million so far so we have the grant agreements for those that I can attachYeah because I remember like even for my HNB they had asked because we were just setting up the organization so they had asked us toTo give the grant agreement because they will no tax returns file so in the first yearYou have taken steps in Puerto Rico OKIn the United States so that makes all the difference that's why the plan in the business plan send to us statement you need to make sure that you literallyIndicate every single step inference of your endeavor that you've taken so far OK OK the current status of software things are OKAnything elseWe will need the right visaThe approvalRight nowAnd you're from the visa so I can hold dolphin but I can send the 797 approval notice thatOKI think I asked about the interestLetter of recommendation we talked aboutAnd then timeline also we have spoken so yeah I think I think because also I'll be in India and I'll be not working for a bit I will have capacity to to prepare all the documentation and remove the documentWe're gonna set up the next meeting and we're gonna send the invitation shortly OK and I'll be waiting for the documents and I'm gonna send you my post to be an email in a couple minutes OK perfect that sounds greatOK nice meeting you let's get it sorted yeah yeah thank you so

your endeavor that you've taken so far OK OK the current status of software things are OKAnything elseWe will need the right visaThe approvalRight nowAnd you're from the visa so I can hold dolphin but I can send the 797 approval notice thatOKI think I asked about the interestLetter of recommendation we talked aboutAnd then timeline also we have spoken so yeah I think I think because also I'll be in India and I'll be not working for a bit I will have capacity to to prepare all the documentation and remove the documentWe're gonna set up the next meeting and we're gonna send the invitation shortly

welcome email we're going to find a link that will take you to our platform where you cannot upload documents directly to our portal and I also do something for the document where we're going to be todayThey are formal links on the bottom of the emailOne question about your education so you have a bachelors degree rightEngineeringYou also have a degree in national Institute of technologyYeah that's my bachelors degree the university of an MBA specialization for an NBAYeahEducation evaluation for the NBA yearI used the service for my H&B application that translated that attend the education evaluation but I was looking at the list that you all have recommended and it was a different provider so I'm not sure but yeah I have done it before and it was an equivalent MBA toDo you thinkIn the MBA and also the education evaluation that you have yeah I can I can send you do you need the hardcopies or the scan copy is goodPerfect so I have the scanned copies that I can uploadUpYeah OK I'll do that OK because you have masters in MB to prove for experience is necessary for the vacation however the more experience improve the stronger your kids becomes under the national interest waiver bro OK so any work certificate that you had any workAny offer letters but you cannot detailed letters employment verification letters I included one for one for your reference and it's under the abbreviation WELOK ideally I'd like to use those letters with more details so US can connect your experience with your endeavorGot itSo far so I just looked at that format so for my like all the work experience that I had in India which is close to like eight years that I already have like work experience certificates from them again I use the same ones for HNB and then my last employer hereWhere I worked for close to six years I can get a similar certificate from themSo like youDouble check your city to make sure all the information that you shared is complete and up-to-date the TV is going to be our checklist when we are putting your keys together we use the reference OKI want to discuss with you about your endeavor endeavors a project that you want to develop in the US they will bring the benefit to the country OK endeavor must be something that you are ready for me and you have an expert teasingEndeavor must be related directly your education in your work experience so what day would like to bring to the tableI also wanted to discuss last year when I switched the job it was to launch this new fund in Colorado along with the CEO and the partner who launched this firmWe have raised $50 million to invest in education organizations here US a goal is to support the growth of charter schools across Colorado which is similar to the work that I did for six years but now only focused on Colorado so within within like that within that work I lead in innovation schools strategy and then rural micro school expansion strategySo so we basically our goal over five years is to support 25 charter schools that are serving low income families and historical under our students in ColoradoWithin that 25 schools our goal is to at least have five Hallmark schools innovative schools that will basically be national exam large and then other states can come and learn from these models and then replicate in their states so these innovation innovative schools are across three buckets one is next general learningSo integrating artificial intelligence into their core model to support teachers improve their efficiency so we are working on two models right now to schools supporting them to launch next in fall of 2027 so so that is one strategy the second one is more career connected learning so supporting schools that will be having industry partnerships and working with high school students to have like a clear career pathways and then the third one is more around dual language schools so Colorado has seen significant growth in Latino Hispanic student PopulationOver the last five years so we want to be intentional about like having charter schools that are providing to a language support to support the growth and learning of those students so those are the three buckets that are under the innovation strategy and then that other piece is the rural education strategy that I'm leading so we like a lot of mountain and rural areas here in Colorado outside of the front rangeDon't have a lot of school choice options there is just one district schools and the performance of those district schools very depending on district district so we are basically supporting school leaders to open micro schools in these regions to serve the student population there again micro schools have been around in the United States but none of them have operated under the public framework like a lot of these are independent private schoolsThat charged like $40,000 to families we are trying to support the leaders who can basically offer a free public schools in these rural areas those are two strategies that I lead which I highlighted in my as well so that's my proposed end of like we are in the second year of the fund now but we will be continuing that workSo we just need to put into words to describe that is the proposed endeavor guidance so you're just going to prepare a draft OK it's not gonna be final we are gonna take care of the final draft and strategy for youWe just need to write down what you have in mind OK what you really wanna do why because no one better than us know what they do best because they will be looking at the experienceRecommendation that we were going to explain next must be part of a puzzle we need to put the pieces togetherOK because the foundation of the keys do you think it's possible for us to send a first draft by Monday this MondayWhen you say the firstOne clarification question I had to I will be already have the business plan for this fund that we have launched so but like it's it's the business plan and that's how we raised money from the philanthropic organizations but like that that fun is basically or like the business plan is basically like what as an organization I want to do but I'm guessing as the proposed endeavor I need to focus on like what would be my role and activities is that correctOK yeah showingThat's the plan which is if you're going to open a business with a business plan is to describe exactly how you're going to carry out you OK so but you already organization this was launched last year we already have the funds raised and I've already supported around 11 schools right now do you think you canYeah I can I can share the business plan and then I can create a separate one page with it which basically focuses on my role and my activities so it's clear that it's not the organization versus like what immigration wants to seeOKRecommendationFrom the fieldSo the higher highest the position the better we asked for at least three letters of recommendation and at least one should come from where we go in independent source someone would have worked the record with you but his knowledge of your accomplishmentsIs someone unbiasedSo when you say independentThat I have not worked with beforeSo like can it be like one of the school leaders that like I don't directly work with them but we have invested or like supported them through a grant like yesWould that be would that be counter as as independent or because he has to work directly with you so they were not part of our organization this is somebody who we have supported because I was thinking of at least getting two or three letters from either the schools that we have supported so these are the CEOs of those networksOr we were talking about or I was thinking of getting some of the ecosystem partners including district officials to get a letter so that I canYeah those would probably be counted as independent because they're not part of the organizationWe also needYou don't have to draft the letters we draft the letter for them and you just have to complete one question for recommender OK where you need to work publishment project you have participating how your role was important to the project so we need to don't be bothered with the letters or recommendation we need to beOne point we need we need to highlight your your skills in how exceptional you are and what you doOKHow much impact does it create based on the profile of the recommenderYeah the higher the higher up and the more position like higher positions they are like the better right OKOK so like what would I need from those recommenders like do so when is the letter that basically highlights the projects that I worked with them on and my contribution and black party OK OKOK and then you said we will also require their CV to be attachedOKOKSo do you have any kids now no I have I have one kid and he is a US citizen so should be here so are you thinking about a processing yes that's because again my H1B is valid till July 2027So ideally againYeah I think that would be better because then at least we'll hear back soonerIn case I would recommend processing because you wanna know what's gonna happen you know when you need to extend your stay hereI have to agree with you that timeline we don't need to file strong in solid caseWorried about timeline because of the situation with visibility and also because of the issues that is going on right now we don't want you to be affected by anyIncrease in the filing fee OK or by any craziness that may be going on eventually so two months is what we need to file a case we don't need one in two months OKSacrifice and quality of the documentThat was one of the questions like two questions I had related to that one wasOne was yeah I think given like the recent H1B changes again based on what I've learned and the lawyers who filed my HNB like they said that currently based on the language it doesn't impact trends but you never know for what changes in future because it's changing every every monthBut for now like given like so if I get this HB like this if this gets approved and if I file for my H one B renewal like would that have an impact based on the current understandingVery satisfied in United States pretty much is only the first applicants first applicant and it's more when it comes to visa abroad OK we are gonna know we're gonna have some clarifications on that in the next three months OKYeah and then the second question was that yeah I think even I'm targeting to file itBy like January 1 week alsoBut because but like I'll be traveling to India later this month and will be will be back by end of the year so will be back around December 30 so so I know like today's October so if we say two months it will be end of December so yeah around January 1 week is when I was also hoping to like once I'm back like we can file so that my H&B status everything is updated I 94 and everythingDo you have a ball I'll have to get a stamp I have the 797 approved which I need to get the stampingIn your journey get invited to go get this the last week of stamps that got approved in India nobody was asked additional fees so both my attorney and then my wife who works with at Amazon she also need to get stamps for both her lawyers have approved like said like we can visit and get the stamp done this new fee should not apply to usOK three weeks from today we would like to have a follow up meeting with you just as the progress that we have made on the case we're gonna be in contact instantly emails within 24 hours on the weekend any questions and any issues please please contact us and make sure you copy the three of us so we can be on the same pageAnd I'm gonna be sending a post an email with all the documents that we need for the first stage in the second stage of the document collection yeah but just to recap like one of theLike the most urgent ones are like I need to send the transcripts and that equivalent like education equivalent certificate and then the second one is the proposed endeavor and updated just double check my CV for everythingEmail shortly so the employment letter is the most recent one like that might take like a week or so at leastOK perfect can do thatIf you have any just make sure it's completed up-to-date if you have received any prize or you have been invited to be anything that you know you can eat you it's applicable to you but it's starting the city important to add and send us the evidence because those things always highlight more yeahBut don't like what I shared about my profile and if you got a chance to look at the CV as I'm putting together the proposed end and like thisWhat would you consider like the strongest elements that I should focus on and thenOKI like to work with you but we get a little at least oneA little interest interest based institution or organization in endeavorSo we already have received grant funding so we have the grant letter from all the funds we have given us the money so so that I can that I can share yeah OKYeah because I think we have commitment for around $40 million so $42 million so far so we have the grant agreements for those that I can attachYeah because I remember like even for my HNB they had asked because we were just setting up the organization so they had asked us toTo give the grant agreement because they will no tax returns file so in the first yearYou have taken steps in Puerto Rico OKIn the United States so that makes all the difference that's why the plan in the business plan send to us statement you need to make sure that you literallyIndicate every single step inference of your endeavor that you've taken so far OK OK the current status of software things are OKAnything elseWe will need the right visaThe approvalRight nowAnd you're from the visa so I can hold dolphin but I can send the 797 approval notice thatOKI think I asked about the interestLetter of recommendation we talked aboutAnd then timeline also we have spoken so yeah I think I think because also I'll be in India and I'll be not working for a bit I will have capacity to to prepare all the documentation and remove the documentWe're gonna set up the next meeting and we're gonna send the invitation shortly OK and I'll be waiting for the documents and I'm gonna send you my post to be an email in a couple minutes OK perfect that sounds greatOK nice meeting you let's get it sorted yeah yeah thank you so much thank you thank you",

          "content": "chico staff of regeneration schools in chicago helped us expand the cincinnati and as a part of that i mean being a part of csgf what was life saving especially being in a small network because i had access to people who had access to tools and people who were just experts in everything that i couldn't be and i just i learned so much and so i love that you're bringing this work really deep in colorado because there's something to be said for geographically concentrated especially when it's your home because i moved back to my home i came back to rochester three years ago and i love it here and it's interesting to see we have a very different charter market there are a lot of mom and pops it is very different yeah it's not rural but it's a small city with a lot of single sites who are reinventing the wheel every day a lot of people who came out of a long career in the district very very interesting but i have been working on a couple core things i've been working with some schools locally particularly around board development how do you hold your school leader accountable for getting results on key indicators and then i've been doing work covering leaves at charter networks because people have to be able to have a baby or a surgery and not have their entire work crash and burn and then i do chartists so i love writing charters i love packaging packet people do best into something that codified and in particular for expansions i love packaging their data like here are your wins here is how we package you to be persuasive and to get people excited i will say with by charters i have written so far mostly established school models so innovative models would be new for me i do have two colleagues that have a lot more experience with this i don't know if you know a lot of feinberg she's based out of boston has done a lot of work with this and morgan ripsky i think in new orleans they actually wrote a charter for one of my clients when i was on parental leave myself did a fantastic job but i think they'd be great for you to talk to as well so what is your need for charters is it more helping coach founders around successful piece or is it writing the right like helping them codify is it actually writing what's the what's the need yeah so i would say there are two schools right now that we are thinking about so one so just a little bit more context we are expecting like more single side charters than network expansions here and part of like our bet is also we are supporting legacy institute which is an incubator here so they provide two years of support extensive support to charter schools so they have their system figured out of how they work with the new school leaders new school founders both from selection to supporting them through charter writing and authorization so that incubation support is kind of so last year they supported two schools that got approved this year and then now they are working with four fellows which will apply for charter next year so that's one part of it but like for these innovative schools like our thesis is that we are only looking to support leaders who have done this before like have school opening experience so that then they are focusing more on the innovative piece than like figuring out like hey how to get enrollment how to get like those day to day stuff figured ok yeah so for them like that is something that they have done before but now they are basically now thinking of like hey this is my next stint where we are like i'm focused on a more innovative school model so for that we have identified one leader that we are incubating directly not through legacy but justin scott he was a leader like he has extensive experience running a charter network he was at kip texas and was the superintendent of one of their like one of the regions i think austin yeah austin region so he has done that for fifteen years has opened multiple schools and he moved to colorado last year worked here for a year and now he's looking to launch his own school again the leader of it is there he wants to work on the career connected industry like that under that theme so he has been working like for the last four or five months he has been working on refining his model learning from other schools he's doing a lot of school visits right now i think the bigger challenge here right now is like figuring out the authorization pathway in the facilities so he is spending a lot of time there but his goal is to basically submit the charter in this upcoming cycle so like here they are trying to standardize the cycle but overall it takes like two years window so like before like so if a charter school leader decides let's say in june that i want to open a school they will be able to open only like two falls after you basically submit your letter of intent in february march and then you get to the board approved like you submit your charter petition i think in april may time frame and then you go get to board vote in june so if you get approved in june then next fall is when you can open the school what legacy fellowship and what we are doing basically is like giving supporting school leaders through for two years one is er zero zero when they prepare their charter figure out facility figure out everything and then year zero to basically prepare for the launch after their charter is approved so right now i think if i have to frame the need again we had conversations here with folks who have been supporting charter schools on charter applications there are few names that have emerged and like people who have done but i think getting a charter approved now has become like significantly more difficult the context here in colorado is that every district has an eca so exclusive charter authority so you have to basically do all your community engagement and stakeholder engagement locally so lot of it depends on the politics of it yeah so every district is the authorizer and have an exclusive charter authority like now there is a pathway statewide overriding there is but in that case also district has to release you so the district has to vote to release you to go to a statewide authorizer which is charter school institute and they have approved bunch of charters but again the district like you have to still go through the district submit your application either get denied and then file an appeal and get released to csi or like directly district releases you charter school institute so i would say that is something where yeah most of the bigger cities have seen enrollment decline and then there are parts where there is growth of enrollment as well because there are new developments and people are also like moving to those areas so again like it's mix of both so what let's say there are two schools i'll just take justin's example so it gives you more clarity so over the past four months like he has spent a lot of time in like figuring out like hey this is the model he's done bunch of writing on like and thinking on like hey this is this is my model but now he's validating by visiting similar aviation aerospace based schools to to basically like say that okay what type of industry partnership work like he has created a thesis now he's basically finalizing his model and then he is also having a lot of conversations with the district folks on like hey what's the pathway to the charter but i think all this needs to translate at some point into like an actual charter so that so that they can they can submit it in in the time frame that they're thinking about so so yeah so that that is where like wanted to and then there is another school that we are right now in the we are in the leader recruitment phase but that would be a very quick turnaround because that's that's a partnership school with one of the organizations we are trying to do so we are jointly recruiting a charter leader hopefully by november december we will have someone we have few names but like we had we are trying to do more national search right now so we have we have that figured out but right now the thing is like if we have to submit the letter of intent in february march we need to get some head start on like at least have the structure have like common pieces figured out so that when the leader comes in like we because they will have to focus most on the model stuff so we are hoping to like do some of the groundwork around like charter writing authorization like having conversations and figure out a pathway there and once leader is on board like we just are able to quickly move yes so those are the two schools that i know where we have the need in terms of like how do we get to the charter like they they are figuring out lot of like external engagement work but like making sure like if if in in case we have to go to a state appeal in either of those cases the if the application needs to be really really strong so so so that is that is the context of like where we need like most support for these school leaders yeah i'll pause there and see if you have any thoughts questions i looked at the charter schools institute there their application and it looks pretty familiar to me and it looks pretty middle of the road like it's not a california application which is thousands and thousands of pages it's not quite sunny in new york which is probably a five hundred page application it's more than ohio it looks reasonable and i i think it's a national trend that the applications have to be much stronger and much more detailed than they ever did ten years ago yeah especially like the questions around like financial viability given the enrollment scenario planning so i think those pieces because one of the charter like i know in boulder valley district we were working with like they got denied last year and three reasons for them were one around financial sustainability second was around the governance structure because it was part of like a non profit which works with neurodivergent kids so they are they they run like an ece for kids and now they want to expand to k five so for them like hey this is a non profit and like this so they had to do a bunch of work on explaining what's the governance structure and how charter would be independent of like no no financial like those pieces and i think the third one was around the again it was related to the budget but was like hey you you basically are talking of like serving significantly high need student population like is it it's not reflecting in your staffing model and like how you are invest making investments across your budget so those were the things where they got dinged so i i agree with you like it has to be like over indexed on more explanation and how you're going to make it work is might be the might be the questions that might come up as they write the charter and okay that makes sense and then the do your people have any financial like people building the financial models or would that be part of writing the charter italy again it depends on on like if if that is an area that you provide support on yes otherwise not then i have i have someone who used to work at yeah who used to work at this charter back office provider and she has now started independent practice and she's really good in terms of like setting up the budget yeah and then like she also knows colorado like what their budgeting is and like presented in that way yeah use her yeah i mean having a state level knowledge of you know obviously state is so funny about hidden costs yeah okay i think i am probably best positioned so if two charters and they're fairly significant you're going to want a team of at least two people if not more and so i'd want to pull in alana and morgan and then probably a separate copy editor and collater they taught me that that is one of the keys to getting an application in on time incorrect okay you have to have a separate person who's copy editing and collate otherwise really do mind because i could probably do justin but not the shorter turnaround because i'm about to start covering leave at prospect schools ok and even then i couldn't do two charters at once but i think with the three of us if they've got capacity and if not i have a couple other people i can have i think we could do this and i think we could do a good job i think i mean depending on the ingestion sounds like he'll be easy to work with because he's codifying his model and he knows the details of like i'm sure he's got a detailed student recruitment project plan already yeah i don't have to create like i don't have to co create one with him the new leader coming in it i think it all depends on who the leader yeah and the leader profile and like their prior experience of doing this yeah yeah but between i think between the three of us and some potentially some other supports absolutely this is this is doable and you're absolutely right to want to lay the groundwork before the person's hired what are there portions of the charter that you have found useful to not entirely standardize across the portfolio but to have best practices around lake facilities with recruitment budgeting where that work could be pre prepped i would say like i don't have the answer to that question i haven't gone too deep into like hey what what are the sections and like how to codify it but what i can do is like i can speak to the person who is at legacy institute because they have done it and they are doing it with four new fellows now i can probably ask them of like hey what are the sections where we can like kind of get a head start codify it and like then once we have the exact model and exact plan like then we can move forward with the specifics but at least like to ask them sorry sorry to catch yeah yeah sure i forget my question will it be a problem if portions of applications are substantially similar will it look like they have copy and paste it because i'm like why are we a mental wheel if you don't have yeah if they are submitting across different districts then i don't think so because like run into an issue where she's been accused of plagiarizing her own work in charter applications and she's like but i i wrote here yeah yeah no again like if it is across different districts then i don't think should be an issue but if it is like the same district we might have to think about how do navigate that but i think like the two schools that we are talking about will be across two different districts so should be okay oh and do the districts have rfps or something published or is it when you say rfp so so denver then so dps so dps basically comes out with like call for applications so they they release it sometimes in february sometime in february like people submit letter of intent in april aurora doesn't have a formal application but they have defined this process of like hey if you are interested in a charter you have to submit a letter of intent to the district and then and then basically work with the charter team at the district to prepare for your evaluation and superintendents recommendation to the board baiju okay but they don't have a formal call to action yeah yeah yeah ah got it okay but they do have an application yeah there is a laid out process but yeah they don't say that hey we are looking for exceptional school leaders for xyz so yeah they're not publicizing yeah but but denver like they they do it like in a more formal way awesome that's nice yeah so like that is something that i had captured of like just comparing the process of dps aps and csi what are the timelines what did they do i can share that document like if that'll be helpful thank you yeah yeah that process wise i can i can i can share that is helpful so from my next steps i'm gonna connect with morgan and alana and see about turning around a proposal for you yeah i think some is gonna be up in the air just depending on the charter process and how in depth they are well probably have to get you a ball like a range for costs yeah because i could tell you like i can tell you right now what it costs to write for suny but but do you have like a like again if it is sunni like is there a range i would say for ten odds application like in ohio for the four demonstrations you're probably running thirty grand thirty to forty grand depending on how much is already done okay in new york pursuing it depends how much is already done but it's closer like fifty to eighty and the reason for the difference is like the amount of work that it that it takes in terms of just the level of detail i mean suny at this point the level of detail they're not just looking for a financial sustainability when they ask you to describe how you're providing lunch a short paragraph of how you're going to bid it out to a vendor is not sufficient got it you need it pick a project plan which is i had a feelings about that the ops person isn't hired yet the ops person's never going to look at this this is just paying for work that doesn't matter it's an equity issue because it's very expensive so only people who know rich people can submit but so what i'll do is like so i'll share that document with you on the process but i'll share an example of like one of the success like most recent successful charter application because it's a public document so i can i can share so so yeah one and one of like the district that approved that charter said that hey this was one of the strongest application that we have ever seen so it's a good example to basically say that what level of detail like would be good to include in that so that can give you like a comparison point of like how does it look looks like against new york or ohio perfect perfect okay so those two things i can do and then yeah but these at least like the range was helpful for me to like now go back to justin and see how he's thinking about it so and then yeah just in justin's done this before if he just needs like polishing or making it into a coherent whole that's also different yeah it all depends on what he needs okay so again with justin i can have the conversation he's already there he's planning to submit so i can ask that question get back to you on like hey can you hire you're gonna with the new hire i don't know where things are and what level of deep like support they would require but my guess is that it would be like a more comprehensive support than what even this turnaround time right would have done right you don't want them scrambling right right yeah so okay so that's the third thing on my end that i'll check and i'll get back to you which so three of these things might help you in like writing the scope of work and yeah yeah okay perfect that'll be great yeah cool so i think this is this is super helpful i know we had a time like thanks for hopping on the call and like walking me through like hey how how you engage with the schools again but you said that depending on the scope of work like you can adjust the capacity and like the time dedication okay perfect cool so i'll i'll get back to you with these three things and then we can then take it from there wonderful thanks so much yeah thank you i hope you have a good weekend",

packet people do best into something that codified and in particular for expansions i love packaging their data like here are your wins here is how we package you to be persuasive and to get people excited i will say with by charters i have written so far mostly established school models so innovative models would be new for me i do have two colleagues that have a lot more experience with this i don't know if you know a lot of feinberg she's based out of boston has done a lot of work with this and morgan ripsky i think in new orleans they actually wrote a charter for one of my clients when i was on parental leave myself did a fantastic job but i think they'd be great for you to talk to as well so what is your need for charters is it more helping coach founders around successful piece or is it writing the right like helping them codify is it actually writing what's the what's the need yeah so i would say there are two schools right now that we are thinking about so one so just a little bit more context we are expecting like more single side charters than network expansions here and part of like our bet is also we are supporting legacy institute which is an incubator here so they provide two years of support extensive support to charter schools so they have their system figured out of how they work with the new school leaders new school founders both from selection to supporting them through charter writing and authorization so that incubation support is kind of so last year they supported two schools that got approved this year and then now they are working with four fellows which will apply for charter next year so that's one part of it but like for these innovative schools like our thesis is that we are only looking to support leaders who have done this before like have school opening experience so that then they are focusing more on the innovative piece than like figuring out like hey how to get enrollment how to get like those day to day stuff figured ok yeah so for them like that is something that they have done before but now they are basically now thinking of like hey this is my next stint where we are like i'm focused on a more innovative school model so for that we have identified one leader that we are incubating directly not through legacy but justin scott he was a leader like he has extensive experience running a charter network he was at kip texas and was the superintendent of one of their like one of the regions i think austin yeah austin region so he has done that for fifteen years has opened multiple schools and he moved to colorado last year worked here for a year and now he's looking to launch his own school again the leader of it is there he wants to work on the career connected industry like that under that theme so he has been working like for the last four or five months he has been working on refining his model learning from other schools he's doing a lot of school visits right now i think the bigger challenge here right now is like figuring out the authorization pathway in the facilities so he is spending a lot of time there but his goal is to basically submit the charter in this upcoming cycle so like here they are trying to standardize the cycle but overall it takes like two years window so like before like so if a charter school leader decides let's say in june that i want to open a school they will be able to open only like two falls after you basically submit your letter of intent in february march and then you get to the board approved like you submit your charter petition i think in april may time frame and then you go get to board vote in june so if you get approved in june then next fall is when you can open the school what legacy fellowship and what we are doing basically is like giving supporting school leaders through for two years one is er zero zero when they prepare their charter figure out facility figure out everything and then year zero to basically prepare for the launch after their charter is approved so right now i think if i have to frame the need again we had conversations here with folks who have been supporting charter schools on charter applications there are few names that have emerged and like people who have done but i think getting a charter approved now has become like significantly more difficult the context here in colorado is that every district has an eca so exclusive charter authority so you have to basically do all your community engagement and stakeholder engagement locally so lot of it depends on the politics of it yeah so every district is the authorizer and have an exclusive charter authority like now there is a pathway statewide overriding there is but in that case also district has to release you so the district has to vote to release you to go to a statewide authorizer which is charter school institute and they have approved bunch of charters but again the district like you have to still go through the district submit your application either get denied and then file an appeal and get released to csi or like directly district releases you charter school institute so i would say that is something where yeah most of the bigger cities have seen enrollment decline and then there are parts where there is growth of enrollment as well because there are new developments and people are also like moving to those areas so again like it's mix of both so what let's say there are two schools i'll just take justin's example so it gives you more clarity so over the past four months like he has spent a lot of time in like figuring out like hey this is the model he's done bunch of writing on like and thinking on like hey this is this is my model but now he's validating by visiting similar aviation aerospace based schools to to basically like say that okay what type of industry partnership work like he has created a thesis now he's basically finalizing his model and then he is also having a lot of conversations with the district folks on like hey what's the pathway to the charter but i think all this needs to translate at some point into like an actual charter so that so that they can they can submit it in in the time frame that they're thinking about so so yeah so that that is where like wanted to and then there is another school that we are right now in the we are in the leader recruitment phase but that would be a very quick turnaround because that's that's a partnership school with one of the organizations we are trying to do so we are jointly recruiting a charter leader hopefully by november december we will have someone we have few names but like we had we are trying to do more national search right now so we have we have that figured out but right now the thing is like if we have to submit the letter of intent in february march we need to get some head start on like at least have the structure have like common pieces figured out so that when the leader comes in like we because they will have to focus most on the model stuff so we are hoping to like do some of the groundwork around like charter writing authorization like having conversations and figure out a pathway there and once leader is on board like we just are able to quickly move yes so those are the two schools that i know where we have the need in terms of like how do we get to the charter like they they are figuring out lot of like external engagement work but like making sure like if if in in case we have to go to a state appeal in either of those cases the if the application needs to be really really strong so so so that is that is the context of like where we need like most support for these school leaders yeah i'll pause there and see if you have any thoughts questions i looked at the charter schools institute there their application and it looks pretty familiar to me and it looks pretty middle of the road like it's not a california application which is thousands and thousands of pages it's not quite sunny in new york which is probably a five hundred page application it's more than ohio it looks reasonable and i i think it's a national trend that the applications have to be much stronger and much more detailed than they ever did ten years ago yeah especially like the questions around like financial viability given the enrollment scenario planning so i think those pieces because one of the charter like i know in boulder valley district we were working with like they got denied last year and three reasons for them were one around financial sustainability second was around the governance structure because it was part of like a non profit which works with neurodivergent kids so they are they they run like an ece for kids and now they want to expand to k five so for them like hey this is a non profit and like this so they had to do a bunch of work on explaining what's the governance structure and how charter would be independent of like no no financial like those pieces and i think the third one was around the again it was related to the budget but was like hey you you basically are talking of like serving significantly high need student population like is it it's not reflecting in your staffing model and like how you are invest making investments across your budget so those were the things where they got dinged so i i agree with you like it has to be like over indexed on more explanation and how you're going to make it work is might be the might be the questions that might come up as they write the charter and okay that makes sense and then the do your people have any financial like people building the financial models or would that be part of writing the charter italy again it depends on on like if if that is an area that you provide support on yes otherwise not then i have i have someone who used to work at yeah who used to work at this charter back office provider and she has now started independent practice and she's really good in terms of like setting up the budget yeah and then like she also knows colorado like what their budgeting is and like presented in that way yeah use her yeah i mean having a state level knowledge of you know obviously state is so funny about hidden costs yeah okay i think i am probably best positioned so if two charters and they're fairly significant you're going to want a team of at least two people if not more and so i'd want to pull in alana and morgan and then probably a separate copy editor and collater they taught me that that is one of the keys to getting an application in on time incorrect okay you have to have a separate person who's copy editing and collate otherwise really do mind because i could probably do justin but not the shorter turnaround because i'm about to start covering leave at prospect schools ok and even then i couldn't do two charters at once but i think with the three of us if they've got capacity and if not i have a couple other people i can have i think we could do this and i think we could do a good job i think i mean depending on the ingestion sounds like he'll be easy to work with because he's codifying his model and he knows the details of like i'm sure he's got a detailed student recruitment project plan already yeah i don't have to create like i don't have to co create one with him the new leader coming in it i think it all depends on who the leader yeah and the leader profile and like their prior experience of doing this yeah yeah but between i think between the three of us and some potentially some other supports absolutely this is this is doable and you're absolutely right to want to lay the groundwork before the person's hired what are there portions of the charter that you have found useful to not entirely standardize across the portfolio but to have best practices around lake facilities with recruitment budgeting where that work could be pre prepped i would say like i don't have the answer to that question i haven't gone too deep into like hey what what are the sections and like how to codify it but what i can do is like i can speak to the person who is at legacy institute because they have done it and they are doing it with four new fellows now i can probably ask them of like hey what are the sections where we can like kind of get a head start codify it and like then once we have the exact model and exact plan like then we can move forward with the specifics but at least like to ask them sorry sorry to catch yeah yeah sure i forget my question will it be a problem if portions of applications are substantially similar will it look like they have copy and paste it because i'm like why are we a mental wheel if you don't have yeah if they are submitting across different districts then i don't think so because like run into an issue where she's been accused of plagiarizing her own work in charter applications and she's like but i i wrote here yeah yeah no again like if it is across different districts then i don't think should be an issue but if it is like the same district we might have to think about how do navigate that but i think like the two schools that we are talking about will be across two different districts so should be okay oh and do the districts have rfps or something published or is it when you say rfp so so denver then so dps so dps basically comes out with like call for applications so they they release it sometimes in february sometime in february like people submit letter of intent in april aurora doesn't have a formal application but they have defined this process of like hey if you are interested in a charter you have to submit a letter of intent to the district and then and then basically work with the charter team at the district to prepare for your evaluation and superintendents recommendation to the board baiju okay but they don't have a formal call to action yeah yeah yeah ah got it okay but they do have an application yeah there is a laid out process but yeah they don't say that hey we are looking for exceptional school leaders for xyz so yeah they're not publicizing yeah but but denver like they they do it like in a more formal way awesome that's nice yeah so like that is something that i had captured of like just comparing the process of dps aps and csi what are the timelines what did they do i can share that document like if that'll be helpful thank you yeah yeah that process wise i can i can i can share that is helpful so from my next steps i'm gonna connect with morgan and alana and see about turning around a proposal for you yeah i think some is gonna be up in the air just depending on the charter process and how in depth they are well probably have to get you a ball like a range for costs yeah because i could tell you like i can tell you right now what it costs to write for suny but but do you have like a like again if it is sunni like is there a range i would say for ten odds application like in ohio for the four demonstrations you're probably running thirty grand thirty to forty grand depending on how much is already done okay in new york pursuing it depends how much is already done but it's closer like fifty to eighty and the reason for the difference is like the amount of work that it that it takes in terms of just the level of detail i mean suny at this point the level of detail they're not just looking for a financial sustainability when they ask you to describe how you're providing lunch a short paragraph of how you're going to bid it out to a vendor is not sufficient got it you need it pick a project plan which is i had a feelings about that the ops person isn't hired yet the ops person's never going to look at this this is just paying for work that doesn't matter it's an equity issue because it's very expensive so only people who know rich people can submit but so what i'll do is like so i'll share that document with you on the process but i'll share an example of like one of the success like most recent successful charter application because it's a public document so i can i can share so so yeah one and one of like the district that approved that charter said that hey this was one of the strongest application that we have ever seen so it's a good example to basically say that what level of detail like would be good to include in that so that can give you like a comparison point of like how does it look looks like against new york or ohio perfect perfect okay so those two things i can do and then yeah but these at least like the range was helpful for me to like now go back to justin and see how he's thinking about it so and then yeah just in justin's done this before if he just needs like polishing or making it into a coherent whole that's also different yeah it all depends on what he needs okay so again with justin i can have the conversation he's already there he's planning to submit so i can ask that question get back to you on like hey can you hire you're gonna with the new hire i don't know where things are and what level of deep like support they would require but my guess is that it would be like a more comprehensive support than what even this turnaround time right would have done right you don't want them scrambling right right yeah so okay so that's the third thing on my end that i'll check and i'll get back to you which so three of these things might help you in like writing the scope of work and yeah yeah okay perfect that'll be great yeah cool so i think this is this is super helpful i know we had a time like thanks for hopping on the call and like walking me through like hey how how you engage with the schools again but you said that depending on the scope of work like you can adjust the capacity and like the time dedication okay perfect cool so i'll i'll get back to you with these three things and then we can then take it from there wonderful thanks so much yeah thank you i hope you have a good weekend",

network because i had access to people who had access to tools and people who were just experts in everything that i couldn't be and i just i learned so much and so i love that you're bringing this work really deep in colorado because there's something to be said for geographically concentrated especially when it's your home because i moved back to my home i came back to rochester three years ago and i love it here and it's interesting to see we have a very different charter market there are a lot of mom and pops it is very different yeah it's not rural but it's a small city with a lot of single sites who are reinventing the wheel every day a lot of people who came out of a long career in the district very very interesting but i have been working on a couple core things i've been working with some schools locally particularly around board development how do you hold your school leader accountable for getting results on key indicators and then i've been doing work covering leaves at charter networks because people have to be able to have a baby or a surgery and not have their entire work crash and burn and then i do chartists so i love writing charters i love packaging packet people do best into something that codified and in particular for expansions i love packaging their data like here are your wins here is how we package you to be persuasive and to get people excited i will say with by charters i have written so far mostly established school models so innovative models would be new for me i do have two colleagues that have a lot more experience with this i don't know if you know a lot of feinberg she's based out of boston has done a lot of work with this and morgan ripsky i think in new orleans they actually wrote a charter for one of my clients when i

      "audioTranscript": "chico staff of regeneration schools in chicago helped us expand the cincinnati and as a part of that i mean being a part of csgf what was life saving especially being in a small network because i had access to people who had access to tools and people who were just experts in everything that i couldn't be and i just i learned so much and so i love that you're bringing this work really deep in colorado because there's something to be said for geographically concentrated especially when it's your home because i moved back to my home i came back to rochester three years ago and i love it here and it's interesting to see we have a very different charter market there are a lot of mom and pops it is very different yeah it's not rural but it's a small city with a lot of single sites who are reinventing the wheel every day a lot of people who came out of a long career in the district very very interesting but i have been working on a couple core things i've been working with some schools locally particularly around board development how do you hold your school leader accountable for getting results on key indicators and then i've been doing work covering leaves at charter networks because people have to be able to have a baby or a surgery and not have their entire work crash and burn and then i do chartists so i love writing charters i love packaging packet people do best into something that codified and in particular for expansions i love packaging their data like here are your wins here is how we package you to be persuasive and to get people excited i will say with by charters i have written so far mostly established school models so innovative models would be new for me i do have two colleagues that have a lot more experience with this i don't know if you know a lot of feinberg she's based out of boston has done a lot of work with this and morgan ripsky i think in new orleans they actually wrote a charter for one of my clients when i was on parental leave myself did a fantastic job but i think they'd be great for you to talk to as well so what is your need for charters is it more helping coach founders around successful piece or is it writing the right like helping them codify is it actually writing what's the what's the need yeah so i would say there are two schools right now that we are thinking about so one so just a little bit more context we are expecting like more single side charters than network expansions here and part of like our bet is also we are supporting legacy institute which is an incubator here so they provide two years of support extensive support to charter schools so they have their system figured out of how they work with the new school leaders new school founders both from selection to supporting them through charter writing and authorization so that incubation support is kind of so last year they supported two schools that got approved this year and then now they are working with four fellows which will apply for charter next year so that's one part of it but like for these innovative schools like our thesis is that we are only looking to support leaders who have done this before like have school opening experience so that then they are focusing more on the innovative piece than like figuring out like hey how to get enrollment how to get like those day to day stuff figured ok yeah so for them like that is something that they have done before but now they are basically now thinking of like hey this is my next stint where we are like i'm focused on a more innovative school model so for that we have identified one leader that we are incubating directly not through legacy but justin scott he was a leader like he has extensive experience running a charter network he was at kip texas and was the superintendent of one of their like one of the regions i think austin yeah austin region so he has done that for fifteen years has opened multiple schools and he moved to colorado last year worked here for a year and now he's looking to launch his own school again the leader of it is there he wants to work on the career connected industry like that under that theme so he has been working like for the last four or five months he has been working on refining his model learning from other schools he's doing a lot of school visits right now i think the bigger challenge here right now is like figuring out the authorization pathway in the facilities so he is spending a lot of time there but his goal is to basically submit the charter in this upcoming cycle so like here they are trying to standardize the cycle but overall it takes like two years window so like before like so if a charter school leader decides let's say in june that i want to open a school they will be able to open only like two falls after you basically submit your letter of intent in february march and then you get to the board approved like you submit your charter petition i think in april may time frame and then you go get to board vote in june so if you get approved in june then next fall is when you can open the school what legacy fellowship and what we are doing basically is like giving supporting school leaders through for two years one is er zero zero when they prepare their charter figure out facility figure out everything and then year zero to basically prepare for the launch after their charter is approved so right now i think if i have to frame the need again we had conversations here with folks who have been supporting charter schools on charter applications there are few names that have emerged and like people who have done but i think getting a charter approved now has become like significantly more difficult the context here in colorado is that every district has an eca so exclusive charter authority so you have to basically do all your community engagement and stakeholder engagement locally so lot of it depends on the politics of it yeah so every district is the authorizer and have an exclusive charter authority like now there is a pathway statewide overriding there is but in that case also district has to release you so the district has to vote to release you to go to a statewide authorizer which is charter school institute and they have approved bunch of charters but again the district like you have to still go through the district submit your application either get denied and then file an appeal and get released to csi or like directly district releases you charter school institute so i would say that is something where yeah most of the bigger cities have seen enrollment decline and then there are parts where there is growth of enrollment as well because there are new developments and people are also like moving to those areas so again like it's mix of both so what let's say there are two schools i'll just take justin's example so it gives you more clarity so over the past four months like he has spent a lot of time in like figuring out like hey this is the model he's done bunch of writing on like and thinking on like hey this is this is my model but now he's validating by visiting similar aviation aerospace based schools to to basically like say that okay what type of industry partnership work like he has created a thesis now he's basically finalizing his model and then he is also having a lot of conversations with the district folks on like hey what's the pathway to the charter but i think all this needs to translate at some point into like an actual charter so that so that they can they can submit it in in the time frame that they're thinking about so so yeah so that that is where like wanted to and then there is another school that we are right now in the we are in the leader recruitment phase but that would be a very quick turnaround because that's that's a partnership school with one of the organizations we are trying to do so we are jointly recruiting a charter leader hopefully by november december we will have someone we have few names but like we had we are trying to do more national search right now so we have we have that figured out but right now the thing is like if we have to submit the letter of intent in february march we need to get some head start on like at least have the structure have like common pieces figured out so that when the leader comes in like we because they will have to focus most on the model stuff so we are hoping to like do some of the groundwork around like charter writing authorization like having conversations and figure out a pathway there and once leader is on board like we just are able to quickly move yes so those are the two schools that i know where we have the need in terms of like how do we get to the charter like they they are figuring out lot of like external engagement work but like making sure like if if in in case we have to go to a state appeal in either of those cases the if the application needs to be really really strong so so so that is that is the context of like where we need like most support for these school leaders yeah i'll pause there and see if you have any thoughts questions i looked at the charter schools institute there their application and it looks pretty familiar to me and it looks pretty middle of the road like it's not a california application which is thousands and thousands of pages it's not quite sunny in new york which is probably a five hundred page application it's more than ohio it looks reasonable and i i think it's a national trend that the applications have to be much stronger and much more detailed than they ever did ten years ago yeah especially like the questions around like financial viability given the enrollment scenario planning so i think those pieces because one of the charter like i know in boulder valley district we were working with like they got denied last year and three reasons for them were one around financial sustainability second was around the governance structure because it was part of like a non profit which works with neurodivergent kids so they are they they run like an ece for kids and now they want to expand to k five so for them like hey this is a non profit and like this so they had to do a bunch of work on explaining what's the governance structure and how charter would be independent of like no no financial like those pieces and i think the third one was around the again it was related to the budget but was like hey you you basically are talking of like serving significantly high need student population like is it it's not reflecting in your staffing model and like how you are invest making investments across your budget so those were the things where they got dinged so i i agree with you like it has to be like over indexed on more explanation and how you're going to make it work is might be the might be the questions that might come up as they write the charter and okay that makes sense and then the do your people have any financial like people building the financial models or would that be part of writing the charter italy again it depends on on like if if that is an area that you provide support on yes otherwise not then i have i have someone who used to work at yeah who used to work at this charter back office provider and she has now started independent practice and she's really good in terms of like setting up the budget yeah and then like she also knows colorado like what their budgeting is and like presented in that way yeah use her yeah i mean having a state level knowledge of you know obviously state is so funny about hidden costs yeah okay i think i am probably best positioned so if two charters and they're fairly significant you're going to want a team of at least two people if not more and so i'd want to pull in alana and morgan and then probably a separate copy editor and collater they taught me that that is one of the keys to getting an application in on time incorrect okay you have to have a separate person who's copy editing and collate otherwise really do mind because i could probably do justin but not the shorter turnaround because i'm about to start covering leave at prospect schools ok and even then i couldn't do two charters at once but i think with the three of us if they've got capacity and if not i have a couple other people i can have i think we could do this and i think we could do a good job i think i mean depending on the ingestion sounds like he'll be easy to work with because he's codifying his model and he knows the details of like i'm sure he's got a detailed student recruitment project plan already yeah i don't have to create like i don't have to co create one with him the new leader coming in it i think it all depends on who the leader yeah and the leader profile and like their prior experience of doing this yeah yeah but between i think between the three of us and some potentially some other supports absolutely this is this is doable and you're absolutely right to want to lay the groundwork before the person's hired what are there portions of the charter that you have found useful to not entirely standardize across the portfolio but to have best practices around lake facilities with recruitment budgeting where that work could be pre prepped i would say like i don't have the answer to that question i haven't gone too deep into like hey what what are the sections and like how to codify it but what i can do is like i can speak to the person who is at legacy institute because they have done it and they are doing it with four new fellows now i can probably ask them of like hey what are the sections where we can like kind of get a head start codify it and like then once we have the exact model and exact plan like then we can move forward with the specifics but at least like to ask them sorry sorry to catch yeah yeah sure i forget my question will it be a problem if portions of applications are substantially similar will it look like they have copy and paste it because i'm like why are we a mental wheel if you don't have yeah if they are submitting across different districts then i don't think so because like run into an issue where she's been accused of plagiarizing her own work in charter applications and she's like but i i wrote here yeah yeah no again like if it is across different districts then i don't think should be an issue but if it is like the same district we might have to think about how do navigate that but i think like the two schools that we are talking about will be across two different districts so should be okay oh and do the districts have rfps or something published or is it when you say rfp so so denver then so dps so dps basically comes out with like call for applications so they they release it sometimes in february sometime in february like people submit letter of intent in april aurora doesn't have a formal application but they have defined this process of like hey if you are interested in a charter you have to submit a letter of intent to the district and then and then basically work with the charter team at the district to prepare for your evaluation and superintendents recommendation to the board baiju okay but they don't have a formal call to action yeah yeah yeah ah got it okay but they do have an application yeah there is a laid out process but yeah they don't say that hey we are looking for exceptional school leaders for xyz so yeah they're not publicizing yeah but but denver like they they do it like in a more formal way awesome that's nice yeah so like that is something that i had captured of like just comparing the process of dps aps and csi what are the timelines what did they do i can share that document like if that'll be helpful thank you yeah yeah that process wise i can i can i can share that is helpful so from my next steps i'm gonna connect with morgan and alana and see about turning around a proposal for you yeah i think some is gonna be up in the air just depending on the charter process and how in depth they are well probably have to get you a ball like a range for costs yeah because i could tell you like i can tell you right now what it costs to write for suny but but do you have like a like again if it is sunni like is there a range i would say for ten odds application like in ohio for the four demonstrations you're probably running thirty grand thirty to forty grand depending on how much is already done okay in new york pursuing it depends how much is already done but it's closer like fifty to eighty and the reason for the difference is like the amount of work that it that it takes in terms of just the level of detail i mean suny at this point the level of detail they're not just looking for a financial sustainability when they ask you to describe how you're providing lunch a short paragraph of how you're going to bid it out to a vendor is not sufficient got it you need it pick a project plan which is i had a feelings about that the ops person isn't hired yet the ops person's never going to look at this this is just paying for work that doesn't matter it's an equity issue because it's very expensive so only people who know rich people can submit but so what i'll do is like so i'll share that document with you on the process but i'll share an example of like one of the success like most recent successful charter application because it's a public document so i can i can share so so yeah one and one of like the district that approved that charter said that hey this was one of the strongest application that we have ever seen so it's a good example to basically say that what level of detail like would be good to include in that so that can give you like a comparison point of like how does it look looks like against new york or ohio perfect perfect okay so those two things i can do and then yeah but these at least like the range was helpful for me to like now go back to justin and see how he's thinking about it so and then yeah just in justin's done this before if he just needs like polishing or making it into a coherent whole that's also different yeah it all depends on what he needs okay so again with justin i can have the conversation he's already there he's planning to submit so i can ask that question get back to you on like hey can you hire you're gonna with the new hire i don't know where things are and what level of deep like support they would require but my guess is that it would be like a more comprehensive support than what even this turnaround time right would have done right you don't want them scrambling right right yeah so okay so that's the third thing on my end that i'll check and i'll get back to you which so three of these things might help you in like writing the scope of work and yeah yeah okay perfect that'll be great yeah cool so i think this is this is super helpful i know we had a time like thanks for hopping on the call and like walking me through like hey how how you engage with the schools again but you said that depending on the scope of work like you can adjust the capacity and like the time dedication okay perfect cool so i'll i'll get back to you with these three things and then we can then take it from there wonderful thanks so much yeah thank you i hope you have a good weekend",

small network because i had access to people who had access to tools and people who were just experts in everything that i couldn't be and i just i learned so much and so i love that you're bringing this work really deep in colorado because there's something to be said for geographically concentrated especially when it's your home because i moved back to my home i came back to rochester three years ago and i love it here and it's interesting to see we have a very different charter market there are a lot of mom and pops it is very different yeah it's not rural but it's a small city with a lot of single sites who are reinventing the wheel every day a lot of people who came out of a long career in the district very very interesting but i have been working on a couple core things i've been working with some schools locally particularly around board development how do you hold your school leader accountable for getting results on key indicators and then i've been doing work covering leaves at charter networks because people have to be able to have a baby or a surgery and not have their entire work crash and burn and then i do chartists so i love writing charters i love packaging packet people do best into something that codified and in particular for expansions i love packaging their data like here are your wins here is how we package you to be persuasive and to get people excited i will say with by charters i have written so far mostly established school models so innovative models would be new for me i do have two colleagues that have a lot more experience with this i don't know if you know a lot of feinberg she's based out of boston has done a lot of work with this and morgan ripsky i think in new orleans they actually wrote a charter for one of my clients when i was on parental leave myself did a fantastic job but i think they'd be great for you to talk to as well so what is your need for charters is it more helping coach founders around successful piece or is it writing the right like helping them codify is it actually writing what's the what's the need yeah so i would say there are two schools right now that we are thinking about so one so just a little bit more context we are expecting like more single side charters than network expansions here and part of like our bet is also we are supporting legacy institute which is an incubator here so they provide two years of support extensive support to charter schools so they have their system figured out of how they work with the new school leaders new school founders both from selection to supporting them through charter writing and authorization so that incubation support is kind of so last year they supported two schools that got approved this year and then now they are working with four fellows which will apply for charter next year so that's one part of it but like for these innovative schools like our thesis is that we are only looking to support leaders who have done this before like have school opening experience so that then they are focusing more on the innovative piece than like figuring out like hey how to get enrollment how to get like those day to day stuff figured ok yeah so for them like that is something that they have done before but now they are basically now thinking of like hey this is my next stint where we are like i'm focused on a more innovative school model so for that we have identified one leader that we are incubating directly not through legacy but justin scott he was a leader like he has extensive experience running a charter network he was at kip texas and was the superintendent of one of their like one of the regions i think austin yeah austin region so he has done that for fifteen years has opened multiple schools and he moved to colorado last year worked here for a year and now he's looking to launch his own school again the leader of it is there he wants to work on the career connected industry like that under that theme so he has been working like for the last four or five months he has been working on refining his model learning from other schools he's doing a lot of school visits right now i think the bigger challenge here right now is like figuring out the authorization pathway in the facilities so he is spending a lot of time there but his goal is to basically submit the charter in this upcoming cycle so like here they are trying to standardize the cycle but overall it takes like two years window so like before like so if a charter school leader decides let's say in june that i want to open a school they will be able to open only like two falls after you basically submit your letter of intent in february march and then you get to the board approved like you submit your charter petition i think in april may time frame and then you go get to board vote in june so if you get approved in june then next fall is when you can open the school what legacy fellowship and what we are doing basically is like giving supporting school leaders through for two years one is er zero zero when they prepare their charter figure out facility figure out everything and then year zero to basically prepare for the launch after their charter is approved so right now i think if i have to frame the need again we had conversations here with folks who have been supporting charter schools on charter applications there are few names that have emerged and like people who have done but i think getting a charter approved now has become like significantly more difficult the context here in colorado is that every district has an eca so exclusive charter authority so you have to basically do all your community engagement and stakeholder engagement locally so lot of it depends on the politics of it yeah so every district is the authorizer and have an exclusive charter authority like now there is a pathway statewide overriding there is but in that case also district has to release you so the district has to vote to release you to go to a statewide authorizer which is charter school institute and they have approved bunch of charters but again the district like you have to still go through the district submit your application either get denied and then file an appeal and get released to csi or like directly district releases you charter school institute so i would say that is something where yeah most of the bigger cities have seen enrollment decline and then there are parts where there is growth of enrollment as well because there are new developments and people are also like moving to those areas so again like it's mix of both so what let's say there are two schools i'll just take justin's example so it gives you more clarity so over the past four months like he has spent a lot of time in like figuring out like hey this is the model he's done bunch of writing on like and thinking on like hey this is this is my model but now he's validating by visiting similar aviation aerospace based schools to to basically like say that okay what type of industry partnership work like he has created a thesis now he's basically finalizing his model and then he is also having a lot of conversations with the district folks on like hey what's the pathway to the charter but i think all this needs to translate at some point into like an actual charter so that so that they can they can submit it in in the time frame that they're thinking about so so yeah so that that is where like wanted to and then there is another school that we are right now in the we are in the leader recruitment phase but that would be a very quick turnaround because that's that's a partnership school with one of the organizations we are trying to do so we are jointly recruiting a charter leader hopefully by november december we will have someone we have few names but like we had we are trying to do more national search right now so we have we have that figured out but right now the thing is like if we have to submit the letter of intent in february march we need to get some head start on like at least have the structure have like common pieces figured out so that when the leader comes in like we because they will have to focus most on the model stuff so we are hoping to like do some of the groundwork around like charter writing authorization like having conversations and figure out a pathway there and once leader is on board like we just are able to quickly move yes so those are the two schools that i know where we have the need in terms of like how do we get to the charter like they they are figuring out lot of like external engagement work but like making sure like if if in in case we have to go to a state appeal in either of those cases the if the application needs to be really really strong so so so that is that is the context of like where we need like most support for these school leaders yeah i'll pause there and see if you have any thoughts questions i looked at the charter schools institute there their application and it looks pretty familiar to me and it looks pretty middle of the road like it's not a california application which is thousands and thousands of pages it's not quite sunny in new york which is probably a five hundred page application it's more than ohio it looks reasonable and i i think it's a national trend that the applications have to be much stronger and much more detailed than they ever did ten years ago yeah especially like the questions around like financial viability given the enrollment scenario planning so i think those pieces because one of the charter like i know in boulder valley district we were working with like they got denied last year and three reasons for them were one around financial sustainability second was around the governance structure because it was part of like a non profit which works with neurodivergent kids so they are they they run like an ece for kids and now they want to expand to k five so for them like hey this is a non profit and like this so they had to do a bunch of work on explaining what's the governance structure and how charter would be independent of like no no financial like those pieces and i think the third one was around the again it was related to the budget but was like hey you you basically are talking of like serving significantly high need student population like is it it's not reflecting in your staffing model and like how you are invest making investments across your budget so those were the things where they got dinged so i i agree with you like it has to be like over indexed on more explanation and how you're going to make it work is might be the might be the questions that might come up as they write the charter and okay that makes sense and then the do your people have any financial like people building the financial models or would that be part of writing the charter italy again it depends on on like if if that is an area that you provide support on yes otherwise not then i have i have someone who used to work at yeah who used to work at this charter back office provider and she has now started independent practice and she's really good in terms of like setting up the budget yeah and then like she also knows colorado like what their budgeting is and like presented in that way yeah use her yeah i mean having a state level knowledge of you know obviously state is so funny about hidden costs yeah okay i think i am probably best positioned so if two charters and they're fairly significant you're going to want a team of at least two people if not more and so i'd want to pull in alana and morgan and then probably a separate copy editor and collater they taught me that that is one of the keys to getting an application in on time incorrect okay you have to have a separate person who's copy editing and collate otherwise really do mind because i could probably do justin but not the shorter turnaround because i'm about to start covering leave at prospect schools ok and even then i couldn't do two charters at once but i think with the three of us if they've got capacity and if not i have a couple other people i can have i think we could do this and i think we could do a good job i think i mean depending on the ingestion sounds like he'll be easy to work with because he's codifying his model and he knows the details of like i'm sure he's got a detailed student recruitment project plan already yeah i don't have to create like i don't have to co create one with him the new leader coming in it i think it all depends on who the leader yeah and the leader profile and like their prior experience of doing this yeah yeah but between i think between the three of us and some potentially some other supports absolutely this is this is doable and you're absolutely right to want to lay the groundwork before the person's hired what are there portions of the charter that you have found useful to not entirely standardize across the portfolio but to have best practices around lake facilities with recruitment budgeting where that work could be pre prepped i would say like i don't have the answer to that question i haven't gone too deep into like hey what what are the sections and like how to codify it but what i can do is like i can speak to the person who is at legacy institute because they have done it and they are doing it with four new fellows now i can probably ask them of like hey what are the sections where we can like kind of get a head start codify it and like then once we have the exact model and exact plan like then we can move forward with the specifics but at least like to ask them sorry sorry to catch yeah yeah sure i forget my question will it be a problem if portions of applications are substantially similar will it look like they have copy and paste it because i'm like why are we a mental wheel if you don't have yeah if they are submitting across different districts then i don't think so because like run into an issue where she's been accused of plagiarizing her own work in charter applications and she's like but i i wrote here yeah yeah no again like if it is across different districts then i don't think should be an issue but if it is like the same district we might have to think about how do navigate that but i think like the two schools that we are talking about will be across two different districts so should be okay oh and do the districts have rfps or something published or is it when you say rfp so so denver then so dps so dps basically comes out with like call for applications so they they release it sometimes in february sometime in february like people submit letter of intent in april aurora doesn't have a formal application but they have defined this process of like hey if you are interested in a charter you have to submit a letter of intent to the district and then and then basically work with the charter team at the district to prepare for your evaluation and superintendents recommendation to the board baiju okay but they don't have a formal call to action yeah yeah yeah ah got it okay but they do have an application yeah there is a laid out process but yeah they don't say that hey we are looking for exceptional school leaders for xyz so yeah they're not publicizing yeah but but denver like they they do it like in a more formal way awesome that's nice yeah so like that is something that i had captured of like just comparing the process of dps aps and csi what are the timelines what did they do i can share that document like if that'll be helpful thank you yeah yeah that process wise i can i can i can share that is helpful so from my next steps i'm gonna connect with morgan and alana and see about turning around a proposal for you yeah i think some is gonna be up in the air just depending on the charter process and how in depth they are well probably have to get you a ball like a range for costs yeah because i could tell you like i can tell you right now what it costs to write for suny but but do you have like a like again if it is sunni like is there a range i would say for ten odds application like in ohio for the four demonstrations you're probably running thirty grand thirty to forty grand depending on how much is already done okay in new york pursuing it depends how much is already done but it's closer like fifty to eighty and the reason for the difference is like the amount of work that it that it takes in terms of just the level of detail i mean suny at this point the level of detail they're not just looking for a financial sustainability when they ask you to describe how you're providing lunch a short paragraph of how you're going to bid it out to a vendor is not sufficient got it you need it pick a project plan which is i had a feelings about that the ops person isn't hired yet the ops person's never going to look at this this is just paying for work that doesn't matter it's an equity issue because it's very expensive so only people who know rich people can submit but so what i'll do is like so i'll share that document with you on the process but i'll share an example of like one of the success like most recent successful charter application because it's a public document so i can i can share so so yeah one and one of like the district that approved that charter said that hey this was one of the strongest application that we have ever seen so it's a good example to basically say that what level of detail like would be good to include in that so that can give you like a comparison point of like how does it look looks like against new york or ohio perfect perfect okay so those two things i can do and then yeah but these at least like the range was helpful for me to like now go back to justin and see how he's thinking about it so and then yeah just in justin's done this before if he just needs like polishing or making it into a coherent whole that's also different yeah it all depends on what he needs okay so again with justin i can have the conversation he's already there he's planning to submit so i can ask that question get back to you on like hey can you hire you're gonna with the new hire i don't know where things are and what level of deep like support they would require but my guess is that it would be like a more comprehensive support than what even this turnaround time right would have done right you don't want them scrambling right right yeah so okay so that's the third thing on my end that i'll check and i'll get back to you which so three of these things might help you in like writing the scope of work and yeah yeah okay perfect that'll be great yeah cool so i think this is this is super helpful i know we had a time like thanks for hopping on the call and like walking me through like hey how how you engage with the schools again but you said that depending on the scope of work like you can adjust the capacity and like the time dedication okay perfect cool so i'll i'll get back to you with these three things and then we can then take it from there wonderful thanks so much yeah thank you i hope you have a good weekend",

me i'm so excited to hear the update i was like yay yes i'm expecting doctor farman for sure lynn may not be able to make it i believe she had to there's a family situation going on she's having to be with her grandkids and there here she is now she's coming anyway do you guys know lynn no okay i was on one of the calls with her before okay yeah okay fantastic hey lynn good afternoon everybody i wasn't talking how's everything going okay there's lots of few moving few more moving pieces but removing them so thanks cryptically glad you're and hopefully doctor fireman will be jumping in shortly in the meantime i suppose lynn it sounds as though you may not know sudachu and lydia after all is that true i don't think we met okay i wasn't their lunch at the league of charter schools conference last year okay it's good to put a voice to a name lynn thank you would you want to so lynn is our treasurer and lynn would you want to give a little bit of your background sure so i have been the executive director of operations in finance for stargate charter school for the last twenty two years so i've been with them from a four hundred fifty kid going into your first financed facility in two thousand three all the way up through this year to where they are now so lots of different experience both in day to day operations in school finance and also into starting and expanding enrollments we're now at one thousand six hundred kids k twelve and doing some additional bond construction at the school and going up with about two hundred fifty thousand square feet of k twelve space so pretty exciting stuff that's amazing and lynn are you still you're still there at stargate i'm not actually retired from that position two years ago i am now the controller for a send classical academies catalytic charter schools so i'm doing some controller work for chris scott at ascent and i've done transitional cfo work for stargate over the last couple years but really kind of tried to push them off on their own the end of fiscal twenty twenty five so i am overseeing their current construction projects because they do have this bond financing that we were lucky enough to bring in with adams twelve issue last year but that is the extent at this point in time ok great well it's good to meet you good to meet you too every time i hear lynn's background i just i kind of get a little exhausted but you clearly she's clearly the person to bring to a facilities conversation well yeah it's such great experience to have on the founding board for a new school yeah this really has been a great honor to help these help these guys move in that direction because i've done what now one two three five financing for stargate and four different major construction projects that's all awesome thank you lynn you bet hi doctor farman hello hi there sorry i'm having some technical difficulties my computer completely died i think the battery actually really fully died so i'm trying to get everything downloaded to my chromebook to be able to get on here thank you for your patience we were just going through some introductions so maybe we'll let you catch your breath and i'll move on to lydia and sudan shu since it sounds like everyone i'm the only one who knows everybody here so lydia or sudanshi would you mind introducing yourself yeah i can go and i'll be quick it's really good to meet you doctor farman and you just said hello to lynn as well my name is lydia hoffman i'm the founder and ceo of the colorado schools fund we launched this organization about a year and a half ago to really support new schools new public schools launching in colorado focused on historically underserved kids but both to provide grants and philanthropic support but also strategic support and to be sort of alongside founders and schools as they expand we have really three principles that we operate from at colorado schools fund the first is we're focused off historically underserved kids so looking at areas across the state where kids may not have access to great schools today the second is we have a really high bar for quality so we're a little crazy about for schools that exist already what their student outcomes and performance like and purdue schools their plan and the leadership to get to a really strong place for students and then the third thing is we're supporting schools that are opening in partnership with their local communities and really driven by family demand so not schools that are sort of just plopping down but ones that are really filling a need in a certain community and my background i spent twelve years an organization called the charter school growth fund which is a national foundation that supports the growth and expansion of high performing charter schools all over the country and i'm based in denver and have two boys of my own ages five and seven so we're at the early elementary years ourselves right now with kindergarten and second grade but it's great to meet you soon after you i'll turn it over to you yeah thanks lydia doctor fowman didn't nice to meet you i am sudanshu and started working with last year at colorado schools fund as we launched my role as lilia explained we support charter schools as they open as they launch and grow my role is also around like supporting the schools around finance facilities and all the other areas coordinating support from our extended team or consultants that we work with prior to that i was at charter school growth fund worked on the grants team and then also spent half of the time there on structured finance team where we were supporting schools on new schools on facilities and then also underwriting some of the creative loan structures to support early stage schools to get access to financing for their facilities and then prior to that i worked in india with a venture capital fund doing ed tech investments both in k twelve and workforce development space and taught in a public school for two years math and pretty much all subjects except their regional language so yeah had some spent some time in the classroom and lot of lot of great learnings from there i love hearing both of your backgrounds i think we've started with debbie and then i came in and we were kind of in the midst of the last application i don't know that i ever fully got your background so i'm so glad we took a moment for this yeah and doctor farman if you want to introduce yourself and just for context i can't i can't even completely verbalize what a game changer it has been to have doctor farm in the home board bringing all of her k five expertise and leadership and we're just so grateful she's here so go ahead doctor i feel like i can never really live up to the compliments but thank you well it's nice to meet both of you i'm doctor susan marie farman i am a first generation american a first generation high school and college graduate and i aged out of the farsis system and i share that because i have historically throughout my career worked with historically marginalized populations either through the special education process and then also with intersectionalities of identity so students who we know that students who are linguistically diverse or students who come from positionalities of poverty or different status of different phases of their status of seeking citizenship here so i've served in newcomer communities they tend to be over identified in special education populations as well and so i've done a lot of work and presentation on the oprah representation of linguistically diverse students students of color and students who are associates economically disadvantaged so it's always just been an important part of my service and my work i started out in center based programs for spirit and program students in seattle and when i moved here to colorado in two thousand seven i started working in denver public schools i've worked in innovation schools charter schools general public school settings but i've gravitated mostly toward places where there were intersectionalities of identities so i worked at place bridge academy for a few years where i could do translation work but also support work for people who are new to american education systems having navigated those myself it's always on my heart to support people to navigate those systems and then that wasn't enough i decided i needed a year supporting adjudicated youth to navigate post secondary systems which is a very interesting endeavor over this last year i was the executive director of a chartering jeffco for a couple of years helping them to kind of rebrand and recenter their school and i also am an adjunct for the university of colorado it teacher graduate course there for human resource management and staff development for them specifically they brought me on a couple of years ago they wanted someone with experience helping leaders to serve diverse populations of staff but also diverse populations of students and so it's been really just an honor to get to do that work and teach leaders how to lead people who may look and sound and be different than them culturally linguistically and economically religiously all of those things and this was especially exciting to me to think about serving the needs of students in a different way and being able to support in ways that we know students need but i don't know that typical public schools can always name right there's just a lot within typical educational settings that you can't address in a way that you can address when you're a charter and so i love the work of being able to shift the need and the budget and the support and the staffing model to fit what you actually need to do for your community so that's kind of just a little nutshell there i've been in colorado since two thousand seven and like i said we moved here from seattle but i've lived all over the country and we travel all over the world and have a deep appreciation for education in any setting great to me too thanks for sharing all that yeah so we can share a little bit and thanks everybody for the brief introductions just wanted to make sure everybody has a chance to get to know one another in addition we can share a little bit about the progress that we've made i went back and looked and i think it was early may was the last time that we had the opportunity to meet and it's just been significant progress in a variety of areas since that point in time i can start out talking a little bit about the governance piece if doctor farman you want to touch on some of the education plans and maybe even some of the messaging component speaking of messaging it was really fun yesterday we were back out in the community finally doing some outreach we revised our intent to enroll and we have our first few intent to enroll sign up so it's exciting to be starting again and it just feels really really good to be back out in the community and talking with folks and they're still super supportive and excited that road is still coming i can speak a little bit to the governance piece and that's something that we're partnering with debbie around so at this point in time we're looking at developing kind of an interim agreement with valswan children's center that recognizing what it means to be a bell swan school and that's something that doctor farman and debbie i think debbie is so grateful to have somebody she can speak apples to apples with now in terms of you know approaches what have you but across early childhood and k five but they put together they have put together some of the components that would be included in being a belong school which we've been asking for for a while and we're just really grateful that that's coming we know that there is interest and likely intention of developing a foundation of some sort that will provide support i'm really hopeful that it's going to focus for sure on research and data collection but then also some potential for fundraising support and that will be a little longer in coming but in the in the meantime we've recognized the importance of being able to say this is the relationship between val swan children's center and grove elementary school not only to make the public and private very clearly separate but also to demonstrate the alignment because we know that that's where the vision and the mission really originated and the approach in making sure that those components are clear so that should be finalized i would say within the next month or so and we'll have that agreement ready to and i know bell swan is also working with an attorney making sure that they're thinking clearly about what needs to go what kind of relationship that needs to be likely something that is more binding than an lu and we may also be providing a fee of some sort to bell swan children center for that support lynn un muted well i was just i was just curious just kind of in layman's terms like how based on where you landed what the what the relationship will look like or what bel swan will be providing or vice versa in terms of what they're providing that's really the next component and the piece that we need to finalize doctor farman i don't know if you'd want to speak to i can pull up with debbie sent me but i wasn't a part of that conversation in terms of the approach and what needs to be included in that approach is that something you'd be able to speak to yeah i think well she's still kind of trying to develop what that's gonna look like i think what she's figuring out is for val swan they know what they do at the ece level what they're trying to figure out because they're as debbie shared with me she's not an elementary school specialist and so for them understanding what it means to be a standards based school and following colorado academic standards and meeting those but within this idea of supporting students in these other ways and so what we've come up with is a framework of working alongside of castles competencies castle the organization for social and emotional learning and really comin ourselves to this foundational component of what it looks like to center that as opposed to it being this sort of peripheral add on so if that's the central tenet of what we're doing as a school then everything else kind of falling in line with that whether it's the curricular options that we've chosen in which case our el rea materials align not only with castle because their castle endorsed and they align with that but also it aligns with the workshop model which we believe is more conducive to students being able to meet their needs in a classroom being able to have small autonomy some space some opportunity for inquiry but also the evidence points to teachers being able to have a little bit more time for intervention time within that structure so everything we've done has sort of cascaded off of that piece in working with debbie i met with her last week to talk about what are the attributes then that we've identified you know that we wanna make sure that we're carefully picking who it is that we align with this work it can't be a teacher that doesn't have any training in special education for example we would want teachers who have some understanding of what it means to be dedicated to social and emotional learning that's still a fairly new area in education in terms of teacher prep programs for example incorporating that into what they do and so that was some of our conversation is what do we need to call out when we're looking for staff to staff a school like this we're looking for people who understand that this isn't a space where voice and choice come off the table if anything we wanna augment student voice and choice that's something that i often have to provide a lot of training for my staff around just in general so what does that look like in a school that's more of a mild moderate setting as a rule in my conversations with the special education director for jeffco one of the things we talked about is believing that there's a space between general education environments and center based programming right we often see that for students who have an iep but we also know there are a lot of students who don't need the educational need for an iep but they still have some pretty significant needs and yes we can give students a five hundred four there are also a lot of families that would just like some support for their children with or without labels what can we do to better support kids within the school setting and so that's what debbie and i are starting to work on right now is so what does that look like what does it mean to staff it what does it mean to support it what is the structures that need to be in place look like what do we name them what does that consistency look like from one place to another and so that's what the conversation that we started last week was really just naming what i call the attributes of the school the attributes of the staff what are the systems and structures that we then create around that to make it look that way i know what the educational programming will look like for grove and i vetted that out and that's almost complete in our application at this point i'm just naming the finishing touches on special education components of that but in looking at that for if belswan was wanting to say hey in order to replicate this what are some key components that someone would need doesn't matter if they follow the same curriculum but having a workshop model really lends itself to that and so that's something i think they need to name if you're going to have an educational setting like this having something like responsive classroom for example is the overarching social and emotional learning support for the entire structure staff and students of the school so you've got to have a school that we'd be dedicated to treating staff in a way that they are role models for student behavior and student expectations so those are just a couple of things i don't want to get into too much detail but those were some of the things that we started to name as attributes does that help a little bit yeah it's helpful and it's also helpful just to understand that sounds like you're still early in the process too of figuring that out which makes sense and the other piece of this that debbie and i have chatted about is really the commitment to developing grove and really developing the model the shared model together and recognizing that yes belle has clearly has a sense of how this is implemented and what the approach is grove is going to hold a whole lot of expertise knowledge and understanding of what needs like what are the non negotiables it's kind of how we've talked about them in the past in terms of a k five setting and making those mesh because belle swan doesn't have that and so recognizing that as we were thinking through like well does grove just become a school of belle swan or do we develop this such that it's kind of a sister or school approach recognizing that there's going to grove is not going to be able to hold the expertise of a k five nor a public school and so that is really something that we're looking at how do we build that into an agreement such that we are working in tandem that it is a partnership still separate but it is a partnership that we are forging together and so that's a definite other piece that we're developing so with that there's the governance peace doctor farming got into a little bit of education plan work there are several components of the next application that will not be district contingent that doctor farman has already completed is working through things that were really overwhelming for us last time in terms of things like waivers and i told doctor farman when she sent me a completed initial draft of the waivers i'm like i remember getting that last time in like opening it and then closing it because it was just really really overwhelming for somebody who was new to charter schools and she's like no i think you know this is what we're gonna need and we can revisit it but you know this is this is the starting point it was like be still my heart so there are several components of the application that are already moving forward and i wanna pause doctor harmon is there anything else that you wanted to add just in terms of that progress or is it okay to move into district and facilities yeah i think that's okay i think the pieces we've covered are the good okay so we reached out in part because we wanted you to have an opportunity to meet doctor farman and also as may not be surprising to you our biggest challenge at this point in time is really facilities and as we've been looking at our options once we took a new building on the site of belle swan children center off the table the world opened up a little bit and because there were some assumptions that were made from the very beginning that's where the school would be maybe we'd have a temporary situation but it was always bdsd and once we took that off the table suddenly the world looks a little bigger and the real estate agent we were working with was really happy but we looked initially at we looked initially at some districts that touched broomfield right because we recognized that bellswan does have roots in the broomfield community and that might be a really important piece so there's adams twelve still boulder ballet school district there's jeff ko we talked a little bit about st brain but decided it might be a little bit of a far reach and more recently even though it's not technically a broom field district we just met with district fifty or i'm sorry not district it used to be district fifty i keep doing that because i used to work in adams county it's a westminster right so in the end i think what we're looking at is how can we identify or let's identify a radius of about a twenty minute drive from valswangeld's center recognizing that that's the center of our network and drop off schedules are everything right if you've got a kiddo who needs to be dropped off at belswan you're not gonna want to drive into boulder to drop off another child right so looking at it could be several of those districts but how do we create that radius and look at facilities that are within that sphere so looking at where we are now in terms of facilities we have one building in jefferson and jeco public schools that is a current charter environment i'm not sure if we've talked with you at all about this but looking at dural academy they have some space right now and trying to forge a partnership there where we might be able to use some of that space that would be wonderful and it's complicated given the status of the current school another thing that we've been looking at there's actually a church that is currently for sale in louisville so it's not a pinot where davidson mesa is not far off of highway thirty six this would be back in bbsd there's a church facility that's in land that are for sale we reached out to see if they would consider leasing they don't want to at this moment in time but we're kind of keeping that in the back of our minds that that is something that could definitely work otherwise i think what we're grappling with and where we've said you know we need some additional expertise obviously lynn's been down the construction road quite a bit but where we're looking for some additional expertise is really thinking about renovation it's an area that you know i think historically we've preferred to see if we could find other facilities where that would be necessary increasingly it seems as though that's an option that we need to consider as we look at the facilities that are available and what the options are and i think that's where we have a little bit of a knowledge gap in terms of the resources that are available and what the potential would be within our time frame of renovating an existing space and if there are for example certain spaces that are better lynn several times over has said churches are great for this and so we have reached out through faith based networks within the immediate area we haven't heard anything back at this point in time but keeping fingers crossed just looking for any expertise resources advice that you could offer in terms of facilities and some of these options that we've found yeah happy to talk through that we have worked on lot of leasehold tenant improvements renovations and again like for startup schools like that's the strategy that we also recommend to have like more leased options or like least two own options but before i jump into that curious on and again like this is like a three dimensional chess that each school who is looking to launch has to play is around facilities as the driver for where to launch or where do where can we get authorized and figure out a facility so i'm just curious like because again like the dynamics of each of the districts that you named are very different in terms of like ability to get authorized so just curious like how you're thinking about the trade off there in terms of westminster fifty versus adams fourteen verses adams fourteen i think is very difficult but otherwise like all the other jets so yeah fourteen would be a little bit far reached but it's a good question i think what we're increasingly hearing is that charter authorization is a bit of an undertaking regardless of where you go and in terms of the relative differences between districts it seems as though every time we ask about another district like with the league like tell us what you know what's going on here it's it's not it's never a real positive message and so i think honestly we're kind of in the in this sphere of one thing that we are considering and i'm reaching out to csi this week with bvsd released a csi was never even on the table so wanting to reach out to them revisit that potential in that conversation because that could tip us one way or another right if we really dive in to csi it seems like a great direction for us to go then it might be it might be worth consider you know considering one district over another at this point in time if we are looking at our preference really is to be an asset to a district to partner with a district and be an asset i'm not saying huge and tell me if you see something different but from what i've gotten across these districts there are relative advantages and disadvantages but they tend to kind of cancel each other out and what we are feeling fairly certain of is that grove is going to do well regardless of where we put it because in part because of our connection to belle swan being a known quantity our approach and having some fairly you know having a fair amount of reassurance that you know this model is something that's desired among families we anticipate it doing well in just about any setting as long as we stay close enough to valswan that said i am open to other thinking around this and again if we meet with csi and suddenly it seems like ok this is a direction we want to go then that changes matters go ahead lydia yeah i was just gonna say i'm just gonna close my door real quick but i am still listening ok i think the csi path makes a ton of sense to consider for the set of districts that are on your list when i think of adams twelve westminster boulder dress girl jeffco's lego yeah and jeffco's like maybe the one with of those the best chance but it still has a lot of turmoil going on right now and so i think the csi release is definitely gonna be the best path if you can figure out how that might work and i think terry will probably have a good sense of those districts is there one that may be willing to release you more than others i know in coming on what i heard from people and i think sudan sus might answer your question too is what i heard when i came on board is people felt such a strong values alliance with bdsd it was very clear that people had developed some relationships there but there was real values alignment and so that was hard obviously when the rejection of the first application happened and people were gearing up to want to do that again but then there wasn't a building of available the reason this shift to jeff cocaine is like heather said the jarrell building we think is an opportunity but it's such an awkward lynn and i met earlier today and we were talking about the logistics of that so darrell owns the building but they don't own the land that it's on but there's also some other things that i think from a building leadership point of view would be really also kind of sticky for us if it were to happen that we got authorized i think there would be some ongoing concerns about the building in general academica i think is the manager but also is the company that built that space for jerrell to be there and what ended up happening was i think a lot of the work that needed to be done in the community before that building was built maybe didn't happen and so it wasn't a desired location for a school as far as the housing community and folks who live there were probably concerned in the homeowners association so there's some stickiness there but then the other layer of that is whether or not that school is going to continue or not and if a partnership is really even feasible in their current state because they were k twelve then they went down to a k eight right now they feel like they do middle school better than elementary but they're not sure that their board is open and it sounds like they're missing more than half of their board members right now with their most recent president resigning last week and so we don't know there's just so much up in the air in the meantime we're trying to complete an application to submit it somewhere and so that's what's tricky too so it does feel like our facility is driving a lot of this just because we do need a place to be it would be nice if we were in the situation where we had a building in each of those places and then we could say oh well our values are most aligned here i did meet with someone for quite some time two folks actually from jeffco and it sounded like from the conversation that we had what they would want is a reassert assurance that we would be sensitive to their current situation of lowered enrollment and closing twenty one schools and the other piece that they would want to make sure that we were one hundred percent not a burden on the district in any capacity that we were fully sustainable financially and that we were nothing but a value add yes that's always the best case scenario and i still may need your technical support team to help me with my website or whatever so i can't say that we would never need any of the services that we would need but i also think they wanted to make sure especially in terms of special education that we were really closely aligned so that was the bulk of our conversation was talking about where we could be a value add in that space without us becoming a center based program which it sounds like they're not really looking for any way so in working closely with them i think if we were to pursue jeffco it would just be a constant stream of mutual communication going back and forth about that to make sure we were pretty tightly aligned in what would best support the district as well for kind of a mutual benefit and a reasonable but terrell was really the reason that we did consider jeffco because it's like you know particularly from a budget standpoint you know bbsd on the surface certainly looks you know like a better option that said there's just nothing there there's just nothing there in terms of facilities that we've been able now if we can renovate if we can get a wrap our brains around renovation a little bit and we could look at there are interesting facilities they just need a fair amount of work to become a school jeffco obviously from a budget standpoint not as appealing but on the other hand there's a building we're willing to consider it honestly i really kind of appreciated the conversation with westminster i'm kind of surprised that we didn't consider that previously it seems as though they may be more likely for a csi release or at least historically that's been their tendency with finding enrollment we have yet to talk to their liaison it was just somebody that i know who does administration at westminster public school so we still need to have a more in depth conversation adams twelve is still on the table both from csi perspective as well as ageists never know there might be buildings there so it's really difficult with the facilities challenge to rule out anybody at this at this point but we think we have a pretty good sense of what our criteria are in terms of csi local funding facilities the political climate like i said if you can give me a sense of don't go there on any of the districts we can definitely consider that it just doesn't it seems like it's a little bit of an uphill battle regardless of where we go i mean and rightfully so right i mean look at the federal situation alone is kind of is a lot so more than open though to your perspective on districts if there's somebody we should rule out or we should more heavily consider yeah i would just say when i said three dimensional chess so one part of it was facilities the part was authorization and the third big part is also enrollment so i think that is something that we also look at when we are thinking about like new schools to like what's the enrollment potential for that particular property because that is again the big driver for like long term sustainability so that just name that also and then i would say on the facility side the spaces that you have looked at or the church spaces or other tim or like spaces that require innovation like are these all up for sale or these are like are these like leads to purchase option or like some some kind of a structure where yeah there's a variety that are out there i don't at this moment in time even feel like i have enough of a sense of what's possible okay in order to really pursue or look at any of them some of them might be least to owe that might be an option for all i know in the church might even be an option that way that would put us back at bbse regardless yeah i just it would just be great to have a sense of like okay should you go down the renovation road there are resources there are not resources you'd have to fundraise you know just having a sense of yeah okay factors no that's helpful so i can then just talk about like what are the different types of not grounds up build but what kind of other facility solutions that we have supported charters with so like the first thing is to start with like understanding the affordability so looking at like in our school budget like on an annual basis we should be able to spend let's say ten percent of your revenue on facilities again typically charters spend around ten to twelve percent but again knowing like groves model that is a number to be tested because some of the schools that were serving high needs student population that i worked with in texas couldn't spend like twelve percent towards that so they were only able to spend like six seven percent at max so just making sure that we understand that number clearly because that then will give us like okay this is the maximum annually we can spend in terms of facilities rent or dead service so once we have that number clarity and we can just do it on the steady state like let's say three hundred student or two hundred fifty students school this is annually was what we are going to spend once we have that number we can basically then like that's a good starting point to start having conversations with folks or the properties that you are evaluating to say that so and then i'll talk about different structures so one is a simple structure where like you have a long term lease but that space requires renovation right so now if it's a commercial space like a strip mall or like a space that you're converting in that case like those are more commercial owners that own that space so for them like there is an incentive to upkeep that space and like maintain it so in those cases i've seen like seller has done or like the the landowner has done the financing for some of the improvements either one hundred percent or have done it in partnership with this school like school raises some money and then fifty percent comes from seller financing so that landowner financing for their renovation cost but making sure that and then they basically whatever loan that they are taking or money that source of capital that they have they basically build it in your lease total amount so negotiating a lease to like hey this is the maximum we can pay and then this is what it would yeah this is the maximum we can pay so whatever the actual lease amount is and all the new construction that would be like it should all add up to like that maximum amount is what you can negotiate with them so so seller financing plus long term lease is is what the common structure couple of schools in aurora and other places have done that both either with church or with or with commercial owners as well and is is that a a model that schools that have opened recently are using or is that something that is five plus years since you've seen that the landscape feels like it's changed so much that i just want to be sure that we're pursuing options that have been used recently yeah no i think these are the options that are that are still like eligible like so again like that's the starting point of your negotiation to ask landowner to finance to to make sure like because you're not owning the space you're leaning the space you're leasing the space so like it's basically like you wouldn't want to spend money in upgrading it and then ten years down the line if again like if it's it's minor innovations and like if it's not too much like and it the budget for lease plus renovation is within your affordability range then you can you can do all the financing yourself and like not but the only condition in that in in that is that it has to be a long term lease like for you to raise financing at least require like ten to fifteen years of lease term for you to be able to finance that because like lenders typically don't finance the term of financing is not beyond the lease term of the the space so negotiating the longer lease term is is what i've seen folks do and this is again a recent example from the springs where colorado springs where it's a it's a lease option but school is bringing the financing to renovate which school was this sometimes it's just helpful to like even go to their website no no it's a private school it's not a charter school it's an independent private school yeah that's doing that and because it's a church space they were like we don't have money to renovate this like we can give it a fifteen year lease but you will have to renovate it okay that's one so yeah we talked about like starting with lease and sell landowner financing lease plus like you bringing the financing but the condition is it has to be a long term lease the third one is typically like least two lease to purchase option again in first two cases also you can do like lease to purchase basically since it's a new school like it's hard to raise financing to buy the whole building but like least to purchase is is helpful because you're locking in the price today so once you get closer to your full enrollment that is the time where you basically buy it from them again two cases like if it's a commercial lender and they commercial owner and they have money they can they can do the upfront they can do the upfront construction renovation work and then build it in your purchase price at the back end but the thing is like you are basically in charge of like hey we don't want to spend more than this on renovation and this is the purchase price that we are fixing today based on your long term affordability number because one of the very recent cases i heard was like they didn't negotiate the price upfront and then in three years their board was like yeah we should probably buy the building and then seller was like asking for a very high price if that feels like this could be a long term home negotiating that that price up front is is what i've seen and then the second one is also like least to least to purchase option but like you are bringing the financing up front but you can do is like if let's say it's a one million or whatever is the number of like renovation that is required you finance it and then refinance it at the time of purchase so you you don't like let's say you're paying the lease for first five years and you have financed upfront the renovation cost and in five years you don't have to pay the whole renovation in five year term like you can amortize it over twenty five years but whatever is left for five years and the purchase price of that building you can refinance the whole thing at the back end like that's the most common model that i have seen is basically because it's very hard for a startup school to raise financing for the whole thing but like if you have the purchase option and you prove your enrollment and financial sustainability in the first four or five years then you should be able to raise like the full financing to buy the building and then refinance your renovation capital as well so those are the four types of like temp or permanent facility temp to permanent shift that i have seen the other option is also like again groups like blueprint like they do this again they they have their fees but again if it all works out for the you know like overall affordability i think that is another option to basically again as a startup school it will be difficult to raise financing but like if they finance like it's it's it's easier to get financing through them it is just that they will have some project management fee associated with it okay and then thank you for all of us and blueprint i think worked with debbie at like when she was evaluating the earlier site and they were like we don't know how this this is going to work so but like they have not been re engaged in like this new site search or this space so yeah yeah okay and in terms of i also reached out today to jane ellis and just thinking about so the work that she does versus blueprint can you give me a sense of like with offerings are there yeah so jane and ccfs they were doing so typically like when you go for this renovation financing also like a cdfi lender or a bank would only do up to a certain loan to value so banks typically do around sixty five to seventy percent cdfis go up to ninety percent loan to value but they still want ten percent to come from the school either as equity yeah mostly as equity in the project but with startup schools like they don't have that level of cash to put in as equity so what ccfs or blueprint ccf is used to do they won't they won't be doing it going forward so what they were doing was basically giving like that ten percent of sub debt which is junior to the main capital so that made banks and cdfis comfortable of like okay we can give the nine percent school doesn't have to put ten percent money upfront that sub debt is basically covering for it and at the time of purchasing the building in four or five years is when you basically refinance the whole capital stack so they bring that initial capital as a sub debt a low cost debt to basically help you raise the senior financing for this project okay so what ccfs was doing like blueprint provides that subnet to in the projects now okay okay thanks that's helpful lynn do you have any comments questions additional thinking around this just in terms of understanding where we are as grove and facilities that we've had in mind i don't think so you know i'm pretty familiar with what's out there in the market at this point in time options basically from a startup standpoint okay i guess my maybe my last question is just schools that you've seen be successful in opening in the last couple of years and what they're finding for facilities what they're doing with facilities anyone you've seen be particularly successful just getting a sense of right now the world almost feels it's not like we went from a world that was this big to this big and now i need to get somewhere around here and some of that will be with regard to the district right certainly if we decide that we prefer to be released to csi and just thinking through factors and the kind either the types of properties or just where people have been most where schools have been most successful recently the two most recent particularly in colorado yeah the two most recent examples that i think like both of those are church spaces or like one is one is actually like sharing space with another school and the other one is just a church space ok which again was a is a partnership with a church where church uses the space on sundays ok i wonder heather if it's worth connecting sidhunter should we connect tether with katie to talk about archdiocese options and just see if there are any in that area yeah i think i think that yeah that could be the other woman who's a broker with the archdiocese and they work from denver like all the way north and have hundreds of properties and she's worked with a lot of charter schools and so it's familiar with the lease to own and the scaling in that you could work on kind of charging you run a line to your enrollment as you're scaling up so i think they'd be worth just just seeing or we can ask her if they have any properties nearby and then connect to if so great absolutely katie what's your last name summer plumber with an h over okay that would be fantastic the other thing i was just going to say is you know the main thing we've learned about the last few years is that enrollment is tough in becoming more and more challenging and i know that you'll have some built in enrollment from the val community but the extent to which you can locate this school really is central to the parent base that you imagine is going to be supportive the better and i know you know that but i just it's enrollment is the thing that's going to make or break you these facilities conversations too and what we know is i mean once we lose the name recognition which we're just another school right and so we know that that is what that that if we can say fortunately brinkfield is such a strange little community with seven school districts and everything and we'd like to that's actually another downside to this space in louisville is that it's like right about twenty minutes from valswan but it's not close to any of the district boundaries which is honestly one of our our best business cases for any district right is that bellswan polls from you know seven different school districts seven to ten different school districts any given year and you know with all of the districts being concerned about declining enrollment that's something that we can actually bring right so going right into the middle of any district probably doesn't behoove us which makes room feels again you know a place that makes a lot of sense just in terms of our the business proposition that we are so regardless i hear that completely we'll be keeping that in mind anything else i appreciate the insight around we're going to continue to work the faith based networks fortunately i know somebody who's pretty well connected in those here in broomfield will continue to look at doral and feel out the opportunity there i was saying to doctor farman it just feels like right now they've got corporate staring at principals staring at board and nothing's moving so unfortunately that's a tough situation but if anything else comes to mind or comes up we're certainly all ears yeah and heather i'll check with katie and then make that connection on the thank you archdiocese speak appreciate that and all the progress is really exciting as doctor farman it's so good to meet you and just exciting there's a leader on board now for this project thank you well thank you all for your time today we really appreciate it we really do and all the information it's good to catch up to speed and thank you yeah take care y'all thank you have a good one bye bye",

she's headed in hi lydia good how are you good good to see i know it's been a little while i know i know we've been in transition mode and i think we're emerging that's exciting right you're telling me i'm so excited to hear the update i was like yay yes i'm expecting doctor farman for sure lynn may not be able to make it i believe she had to there's a family situation going on she's having to be with her grandkids and there here she is now she's coming anyway do you guys know lynn no okay i was on one of the calls with her before okay yeah okay fantastic hey lynn good afternoon everybody i wasn't talking how's everything going okay there's lots of few moving few more moving pieces but removing them so thanks cryptically glad you're and hopefully doctor fireman will be jumping in shortly in the meantime i suppose lynn it sounds as though you may not know sudachu and lydia after all is that true i don't think we met okay i wasn't their lunch at the league of charter schools conference last year okay it's good to put a voice to a name lynn thank you would you want to so lynn is our treasurer and lynn would you want to give a little bit of your background sure so i have been the executive director of operations in finance for stargate charter school for the last twenty two years so i've been with them from a four hundred fifty kid going into your first financed facility in two thousand three all the way up through this year to where they are now so lots of different experience both in day to day operations in school finance and also into starting and expanding enrollments we're now at one thousand six hundred kids k twelve and doing some additional bond construction at the school and going up with about two hundred fifty thousand square feet of k twelve space so pretty exciting stuff that's amazing and lynn are you still you're still there at stargate i'm not actually retired from that position two years ago i am now the controller for a send classical academies catalytic charter schools so i'm doing some controller work for chris scott at ascent and i've done transitional cfo work for stargate over the last couple years but really kind of tried to push them off on their own the end of fiscal twenty twenty five so i am overseeing their current construction projects because they do have this bond financing that we were lucky enough to bring in with adams twelve issue last year but that is the extent at this point in time ok great well it's good to meet you good to meet you too every time i hear lynn's background i just i kind of get a little exhausted but you clearly she's clearly the person to bring to a facilities conversation well yeah it's such great experience to have on the founding board for a new school yeah this really has been a great honor to help these help these guys move in that direction because i've done what now one two three five financing for stargate and four different major construction projects that's all awesome thank you lynn you bet hi doctor farman hello hi there sorry i'm having some technical difficulties my computer completely died i think the battery actually really fully died so i'm trying to get everything downloaded to my chromebook to be able to get on here thank you for your patience we were just going through some introductions so maybe we'll let you catch your breath and i'll move on to lydia and sudan shu since it sounds like everyone i'm the only one who knows everybody here so lydia or sudanshi would you mind introducing yourself yeah i can go and i'll be quick it's really good to meet you doctor farman and you just said hello to lynn as well my name is lydia hoffman i'm the founder and ceo of the colorado schools fund we launched this organization about a year and a half ago to really support new schools new public schools launching in colorado focused on historically underserved kids but both to provide grants and philanthropic support but also strategic support and to be sort of alongside founders and schools as they expand we have really three principles that we operate from at colorado schools fund the first is we're focused off historically underserved kids so looking at areas across the state where kids may not have access to great schools today the second is we have a really high bar for quality so we're a little crazy about for schools that exist already what their student outcomes and performance like and purdue schools their plan and the leadership to get to a really strong place for students and then the third thing is we're supporting schools that are opening in partnership with their local communities and really driven by family demand so not schools that are sort of just plopping down but ones that are really filling a need in a certain community and my background i spent twelve years an organization called the charter school growth fund which is a national foundation that supports the growth and expansion of high performing charter schools all over the country and i'm based in denver and have two boys of my own ages five and seven so we're at the early elementary years ourselves right now with kindergarten and second grade but it's great to meet you soon after you i'll turn it over to you yeah thanks lydia doctor fowman didn't nice to meet you i am sudanshu and started working with last year at colorado schools fund as we launched my role as lilia explained we support charter schools as they open as they launch and grow my role is also around like supporting the schools around finance facilities and all the other areas coordinating support from our extended team or consultants that we work with prior to that i was at charter school growth fund worked on the grants team and then also spent half of the time there on structured finance team where we were supporting schools on new schools on facilities and then also underwriting some of the creative loan structures to support early stage schools to get access to financing for their facilities and then prior to that i worked in india with a venture capital fund doing ed tech investments both in k twelve and workforce development space and taught in a public school for two years math and pretty much all subjects except their regional language so yeah had some spent some time in the classroom and lot of lot of great learnings from there i love hearing both of your backgrounds i think we've started with debbie and then i came in and we were kind of in the midst of the last application i don't know that i ever fully got your background so i'm so glad we took a moment for this yeah and doctor farman if you want to introduce yourself and just for context i can't i can't even completely verbalize what a game changer it has been to have doctor farm in the home board bringing all of her k five expertise and leadership and we're just so grateful she's here so go ahead doctor i feel like i can never really live up to the compliments but thank you well it's nice to meet both of you i'm doctor susan marie farman i am a first generation american a first generation high school and college graduate and i aged out of the farsis system and i share that because i have historically throughout my career worked with historically marginalized populations either through the special education process and then also with intersectionalities of identity so students who we know that students who are linguistically diverse or students who come from positionalities of poverty or different status of different phases of their status of seeking citizenship here so i've served in newcomer communities they tend to be over identified in special education populations as well and so i've done a lot of work and presentation on the oprah representation of linguistically diverse students students of color and students who are associates economically disadvantaged so it's always just been an important part of my service and my work i started out in center based programs for spirit and program students in seattle and when i moved here to colorado in two thousand seven i started working in denver public schools i've worked in innovation schools charter schools general public school settings but i've gravitated mostly toward places where there were intersectionalities of identities so i worked at place bridge academy for a few years where i could do translation work but also support work for people who are new to american education systems having navigated those myself it's always on my heart to support people to navigate those systems and then that wasn't enough i decided i needed a year supporting adjudicated youth to navigate post secondary systems which is a very interesting endeavor over this last year i was the executive director of a chartering jeffco for a couple of years helping them to kind of rebrand and recenter their school and i also am an adjunct for the university of colorado it teacher graduate course there for human resource management and staff development for them specifically they brought me on a couple of years ago they wanted someone with experience helping leaders to serve diverse populations of staff but also diverse populations of students and so it's been really just an honor to get to do that work and teach leaders how to lead people who may look and sound and be different than them culturally linguistically and economically religiously all of those things and this was especially exciting to me to think about serving the needs of students in a different way and being able to support in ways that we know students need but i don't know that typical public schools can always name right there's just a lot within typical educational settings that you can't address in a way that you can address when you're a charter and so i love the work of being able to shift the need and the budget and the support and the staffing model to fit what you actually need to do for your community so that's kind of just a little nutshell there i've been in colorado since two thousand seven and like i said we moved here from seattle but i've lived all over the country and we travel all over the world and have a deep appreciation for education in any setting great to me too thanks for sharing all that yeah so we can share a little bit and thanks everybody for the brief introductions just wanted to make sure everybody has a chance to get to know one another in addition we can share a little bit about the progress that we've made i went back and looked and i think it was early may was the last time that we had the opportunity to meet and it's just been significant progress in a variety of areas since that point in time i can start out talking a little bit about the governance piece if doctor farman you want to touch on some of the education plans and maybe even some of the messaging component speaking of messaging it was really fun yesterday we were back out in the community finally doing some outreach we revised our intent to enroll and we have our first few intent to enroll sign up so it's exciting to be starting again and it just feels really really good to be back out in the community and talking with folks and they're still super supportive and excited that road is still coming i can speak a little bit to the governance piece and that's something that we're partnering with debbie around so at this point in time we're looking at developing kind of an interim agreement with valswan children's center that recognizing what it means to be a bell swan school and that's something that doctor farman and debbie i think debbie is so grateful to have somebody she can speak apples to apples with now in terms of you know approaches what have you but across early childhood and k five but they put together they have put together some of the components that would be included in being a belong school which we've been asking for for a while and we're just really grateful that that's coming we know that there is interest and likely intention of developing a foundation of some sort that will provide support i'm really hopeful that it's going to focus for sure on research and data collection but then also some potential for fundraising support and that will be a little longer in coming but in the in the meantime we've recognized the importance of being able to say this is the relationship between val swan children's center and grove elementary school not only to make the public and private very clearly separate but also to demonstrate the alignment because we know that that's where the vision and the mission really originated and the approach in making sure that those components are clear so that should be finalized i would say within the next month or so and we'll have that agreement ready to and i know bell swan is also working with an attorney making sure that they're thinking clearly about what needs to go what kind of relationship that needs to be likely something that is more binding than an lu and we may also be providing a fee of some sort to bell swan children center for that support lynn un muted well i was just i was just curious just kind of in layman's terms like how based on where you landed what the what the relationship will look like or what bel swan will be providing or vice versa in terms of what they're providing that's really the next component and the piece that we need to finalize doctor farman i don't know if you'd want to speak to i can pull up with debbie sent me but i wasn't a part of that conversation in terms of the approach and what needs to be included in that approach is that something you'd be able to speak to yeah i think well she's still kind of trying to develop what that's gonna look like i think what she's figuring out is for val swan they know what they do at the ece level what they're trying to figure out because they're as debbie shared with me she's not an elementary school specialist and so for them understanding what it means to be a standards based school and following colorado academic standards and meeting those but within this idea of supporting students in these other ways and so what we've come up with is a framework of working alongside of castles competencies castle the organization for social and emotional learning and really comin ourselves to this foundational component of what it looks like to center that as opposed to it being this sort of peripheral add on so if that's the central tenet of what we're doing as a school then everything else kind of falling in line with that whether it's the curricular options that we've chosen in which case our el rea materials align not only with castle because their castle endorsed and they align with that but also it aligns with the workshop model which we believe is more conducive to students being able to meet their needs in a classroom being able to have small autonomy some space some opportunity for inquiry but also the evidence points to teachers being able to have a little bit more time for intervention time within that structure so everything we've done has sort of cascaded off of that piece in working with debbie i met with her last week to talk about what are the attributes then that we've identified you know that we wanna make sure that we're carefully picking who it is that we align with this work it can't be a teacher that doesn't have any training in special education for example we would want teachers who have some understanding of what it means to be dedicated to social and emotional learning that's still a fairly new area in education in terms of teacher prep programs for example incorporating that into what they do and so that was some of our conversation is what do we need to call out when we're looking for staff to staff a school like this we're looking for people who understand that this isn't a space where voice and choice come off the table if anything we wanna augment student voice and choice that's something that i often have to provide a lot of training for my staff around just in general so what does that look like in a school that's more of a mild moderate setting as a rule in my conversations with the special education director for jeffco one of the things we talked about is believing that there's a space between general education environments and center based programming right we often see that for students who have an iep but we also know there are a lot of students who don't need the educational need for an iep but they still have some pretty significant needs and yes we can give students a five hundred four there are also a lot of families that would just like some support for their children with or without labels what can we do to better support kids within the school setting and so that's what debbie and i are starting to work on right now is so what does that look like what does it mean to staff it what does it mean to support it what is the structures that need to be in place look like what do we name them what does that consistency look like from one place to another and so that's what the conversation that we started last week was really just naming what i call the attributes of the school the attributes of the staff what are the systems and structures that we then create around that to make it look that way i know what the educational programming will look like for grove and i vetted that out and that's almost complete in our application at this point i'm just naming the finishing touches on special education components of that but in looking at that for if belswan was wanting to say hey in order to replicate this what are some key components that someone would need doesn't matter if they follow the same curriculum but having a workshop model really lends itself to that and so that's something i think they need to name if you're going to have an educational setting like this having something like responsive classroom for example is the overarching social and emotional learning support for the entire structure staff and students of the school so you've got to have a school that we'd be dedicated to treating staff in a way that they are role models for student behavior and student expectations so those are just a couple of things i don't want to get into too much detail but those were some of the things that we started to name as attributes does that help a little bit yeah it's helpful and it's also helpful just to understand that sounds like you're still early in the process too of figuring that out which makes sense and the other piece of this that debbie and i have chatted about is really the commitment to developing grove and really developing the model the shared model together and recognizing that yes belle has clearly has a sense of how this is implemented and what the approach is grove is going to hold a whole lot of expertise knowledge and understanding of what needs like what are the non negotiables it's kind of how we've talked about them in the past in terms of a k five setting and making those mesh because belle swan doesn't have that and so recognizing that as we were thinking through like well does grove just become a school of belle swan or do we develop this such that it's kind of a sister or school approach recognizing that there's going to grove is not going to be able to hold the expertise of a k five nor a public school and so that is really something that we're looking at how do we build that into an agreement such that we are working in tandem that it is a partnership still separate but it is a partnership that we are forging together and so that's a definite other piece that we're developing so with that there's the governance peace doctor farming got into a little bit of education plan work there are several components of the next application that will not be district contingent that doctor farman has already completed is working through things that were really overwhelming for us last time in terms of things like waivers and i told doctor farman when she sent me a completed initial draft of the waivers i'm like i remember getting that last time in like opening it and then closing it because it was just really really overwhelming for somebody who was new to charter schools and she's like no i think you know this is what we're gonna need and we can revisit it but you know this is this is the starting point it was like be still my heart so there are several components of the application that are already moving forward and i wanna pause doctor harmon is there anything else that you wanted to add just in terms of that progress or is it okay to move into district and facilities yeah i think that's okay i think the pieces we've covered are the good okay so we reached out in part because we wanted you to have an opportunity to meet doctor farman and also as may not be surprising to you our biggest challenge at this point in time is really facilities and as we've been looking at our options once we took a new building on the site of belle swan children center off the table the world opened up a little bit and because there were some assumptions that were made from the very beginning that's where the school would be maybe we'd have a temporary situation but it was always bdsd and once we took that off the table suddenly the world looks a little bigger and the real estate agent we were working with was really happy but we looked initially at we looked initially at some districts that touched broomfield right because we recognized that bellswan does have roots in the broomfield community and that might be a really important piece so there's adams twelve still boulder ballet school district there's jeff ko we talked a little bit about st brain but decided it might be a little bit of a far reach and more recently even though it's not technically a broom field district we just met with district fifty or i'm sorry not district it used to be district fifty i keep doing that because i used to work in adams county it's a westminster right so in the end i think what we're looking at is how can we identify or let's identify a radius of about a twenty minute drive from valswangeld's center recognizing that that's the center of our network and drop off schedules are everything right if you've got a kiddo who needs to be dropped off at belswan you're not gonna want to drive into boulder to drop off another child right so looking at it could be several of those districts but how do we create that radius and look at facilities that are within that sphere so looking at where we are now in terms of facilities we have one building in jefferson and jeco public schools that is a current charter environment i'm not sure if we've talked with you at all about this but looking at dural academy they have some space right now and trying to forge a partnership there where we might be able to use some of that space that would be wonderful and it's complicated given the status of the current school another thing that we've been looking at there's actually a church that is currently for sale in louisville so it's not a pinot where davidson mesa is not far off of highway thirty six this would be back in bbsd there's a church facility that's in land that are for sale we reached out to see if they would consider leasing they don't want to at this moment in time but we're kind of keeping that in the back of our minds that that is something that could definitely work otherwise i think what we're grappling with and where we've said you know we need some additional expertise obviously lynn's been down the construction road quite a bit but where we're looking for some additional expertise is really thinking about renovation it's an area that you know i think historically we've preferred to see if we could find other facilities where that would be necessary increasingly it seems as though that's an option that we need to consider as we look at the facilities that are available and what the options are and i think that's where we have a little bit of a knowledge gap in terms of the resources that are available and what the potential would be within our time frame of renovating an existing space and if there are for example certain spaces that are better lynn several times over has said churches are great for this and so we have reached out through faith based networks within the immediate area we haven't heard anything back at this point in time but keeping fingers crossed just looking for any expertise resources advice that you could offer in terms of facilities and some of these options that we've found yeah happy to talk through that we have worked on lot of leasehold tenant improvements renovations and again like for startup schools like that's the strategy that we also recommend to have like more leased options or like least two own options but before i jump into that curious on and again like this is like a three dimensional chess that each school who is looking to launch has to play is around facilities as the driver for where to launch or where do where can we get authorized and figure out a facility so i'm just curious like because again like the dynamics of each of the districts that you named are very different in terms of like ability to get authorized so just curious like how you're thinking about the trade off there in terms of westminster fifty versus adams fourteen verses adams fourteen i think is very difficult but otherwise like all the other jets so yeah fourteen would be a little bit far reached but it's a good question i think what we're increasingly hearing is that charter authorization is a bit of an undertaking regardless of where you go and in terms of the relative differences between districts it seems as though every time we ask about another district like with the league like tell us what you know what's going on here it's it's not it's never a real positive message and so i think honestly we're kind of in the in this sphere of one thing that we are considering and i'm reaching out to csi this week with bvsd released a csi was never even on the table so wanting to reach out to them revisit that potential in that conversation because that could tip us one way or another right if we really dive in to csi it seems like a great direction for us to go then it might be it might be worth consider you know considering one district over another at this point in time if we are looking at our preference really is to be an asset to a district to partner with a district and be an asset i'm not saying huge and tell me if you see something different but from what i've gotten across these districts there are relative advantages and disadvantages but they tend to kind of cancel each other out and what we are feeling fairly certain of is that grove is going to do well regardless of where we put it because in part because of our connection to belle swan being a known quantity our approach and having some fairly you know having a fair amount of reassurance that you know this model is something that's desired among families we anticipate it doing well in just about any setting as long as we stay close enough to valswan that said i am open to other thinking around this and again if we meet with csi and suddenly it seems like ok this is a direction we want to go then that changes matters go ahead lydia yeah i was just gonna say i'm just gonna close my door real quick but i am still listening ok i think the csi path makes a ton of sense to consider for the set of districts that are on your list when i think of adams twelve westminster boulder dress girl jeffco's lego yeah and jeffco's like maybe the one with of those the best chance but it still has a lot of turmoil going on right now and so i think the csi release is definitely gonna be the best path if you can figure out how that might work and i think terry will probably have a good sense of those districts is there one that may be willing to release you more than others i know in coming on what i heard from people and i think sudan sus might answer your question too is what i heard when i came on board is people felt such a strong values alliance with bdsd it was very clear that people had developed some relationships there but there was real values alignment and so that was hard obviously when the rejection of the first application happened and people were gearing up to want to do that again but then there wasn't a building of available the reason this shift to jeff cocaine is like heather said the jarrell building we think is an opportunity but it's such an awkward lynn and i met earlier today and we were talking about the logistics of that so darrell owns the building but they don't own the land that it's on but there's also some other things that i think from a building leadership point of view would be really also kind of sticky for us if it were to happen that we got authorized i think there would be some ongoing concerns about the building in general academica i think is the manager but also is the company that built that space for jerrell to be there and what ended up happening was i think a lot of the work that needed to be done in the community before that building was built maybe didn't happen and so it wasn't a desired location for a school as far as the housing community and folks who live there were probably concerned in the homeowners association so there's some stickiness there but then the other layer of that is whether or not that school is going to continue or not and if a partnership is really even feasible in their current state because they were k twelve then they went down to a k eight right now they feel like they do middle school better than elementary but they're not sure that their board is open and it sounds like they're missing more than half of their board members right now with their most recent president resigning last week and so we don't know there's just so much up in the air in the meantime we're trying to complete an application to submit it somewhere and so that's what's tricky too so it does feel like our facility is driving a lot of this just because we do need a place to be it would be nice if we were in the situation where we had a building in each of those places and then we could say oh well our values are most aligned here i did meet with someone for quite some time two folks actually from jeffco and it sounded like from the conversation that we had what they would want is a reassert assurance that we would be sensitive to their current situation of lowered enrollment and closing twenty one schools and the other piece that they would want to make sure that we were one hundred percent not a burden on the district in any capacity that we were fully sustainable financially and that we were nothing but a value add yes that's always the best case scenario and i still may need your technical support team to help me with my website or whatever so i can't say that we would never need any of the services that we would need but i also think they wanted to make sure especially in terms of special education that we were really closely aligned so that was the bulk of our conversation was talking about where we could be a value add in that space without us becoming a center based program which it sounds like they're not really looking for any way so in working closely with them i think if we were to pursue jeffco it would just be a constant stream of mutual communication going back and forth about that to make sure we were pretty tightly aligned in what would best support the district as well for kind of a mutual benefit and a reasonable but terrell was really the reason that we did consider jeffco because it's like you know particularly from a budget standpoint you know bbsd on the surface certainly looks you know like a better option that said there's just nothing there there's just nothing there in terms of facilities that we've been able now if we can renovate if we can get a wrap our brains around renovation a little bit and we could look at there are interesting facilities they just need a fair amount of work to become a school jeffco obviously from a budget standpoint not as appealing but on the other hand there's a building we're willing to consider it honestly i really kind of appreciated the conversation with westminster i'm kind of surprised that we didn't consider that previously it seems as though they may be more likely for a csi release or at least historically that's been their tendency with finding enrollment we have yet to talk to their liaison it was just somebody that i know who does administration at westminster public school so we still need to have a more in depth conversation adams twelve is still on the table both from csi perspective as well as ageists never know there might be buildings there so it's really difficult with the facilities challenge to rule out anybody at this at this point but we think we have a pretty good sense of what our criteria are in terms of csi local funding facilities the political climate like i said if you can give me a sense of don't go there on any of the districts we can definitely consider that it just doesn't it seems like it's a little bit of an uphill battle regardless of where we go i mean and rightfully so right i mean look at the federal situation alone is kind of is a lot so more than open though to your perspective on districts if there's somebody we should rule out or we should more heavily consider yeah i would just say when i said three dimensional chess so one part of it was facilities the part was authorization and the third big part is also enrollment so i think that is something that we also look at when we are thinking about like new schools to like what's the enrollment potential for that particular property because that is again the big driver for like long term sustainability so that just name that also and then i would say on the facility side the spaces that you have looked at or the church spaces or other tim or like spaces that require innovation like are these all up for sale or these are like are these like leads to purchase option or like some some kind of a structure where yeah there's a variety that are out there i don't at this moment in time even feel like i have enough of a sense of what's possible okay in order to really pursue or look at any of them some of them might be least to owe that might be an option for all i know in the church might even be an option that way that would put us back at bbse regardless yeah i just it would just be great to have a sense of like okay should you go down the renovation road there are resources there are not resources you'd have to fundraise you know just having a sense of yeah okay factors no that's helpful so i can then just talk about like what are the different types of not grounds up build but what kind of other facility solutions that we have supported charters with so like the first thing is to start with like understanding the affordability so looking at like in our school budget like on an annual basis we should be able to spend let's say ten percent of your revenue on facilities again typically charters spend around ten to twelve percent but again knowing like groves model that is a number to be tested because some of the schools that were serving high needs student population that i worked with in texas couldn't spend like twelve percent towards that so they were only able to spend like six seven percent at max so just making sure that we understand that number clearly because that then will give us like okay this is the maximum annually we can spend in terms of facilities rent or dead service so once we have that number clarity and we can just do it on the steady state like let's say three hundred student or two hundred fifty students school this is annually was what we are going to spend once we have that number we can basically then like that's a good starting point to start having conversations with folks or the properties that you are evaluating to say that so and then i'll talk about different structures so one is a simple structure where like you have a long term lease but that space requires renovation right so now if it's a commercial space like a strip mall or like a space that you're converting in that case like those are more commercial owners that own that space so for them like there is an incentive to upkeep that space and like maintain it so in those cases i've seen like seller has done or like the the landowner has done the financing for some of the improvements either one hundred percent or have done it in partnership with this school like school raises some money and then fifty percent comes from seller financing so that landowner financing for their renovation cost but making sure that and then they basically whatever loan that they are taking or money that source of capital that they have they basically build it in your lease total amount so negotiating a lease to like hey this is the maximum we can pay and then this is what it would yeah this is the maximum we can pay so whatever the actual lease amount is and all the new construction that would be like it should all add up to like that maximum amount is what you can negotiate with them so so seller financing plus long term lease is is what the common structure couple of schools in aurora and other places have done that both either with church or with or with commercial owners as well and is is that a a model that schools that have opened recently are using or is that something that is five plus years since you've seen that the landscape feels like it's changed so much that i just want to be sure that we're pursuing options that have been used recently yeah no i think these are the options that are that are still like eligible like so again like that's the starting point of your negotiation to ask landowner to finance to to make sure like because you're not owning the space you're leaning the space you're leasing the space so like it's basically like you wouldn't want to spend money in upgrading it and then ten years down the line if again like if it's it's minor innovations and like if it's not too much like and it the budget for lease plus renovation is within your affordability range then you can you can do all the financing yourself and like not but the only condition in that in in that is that it has to be a long term lease like for you to raise financing at least require like ten to fifteen years of lease term for you to be able to finance that because like lenders typically don't finance the term of financing is not beyond the lease term of the the space so negotiating the longer lease term is is what i've seen folks do and this is again a recent example from the springs where colorado springs where it's a it's a lease option but school is bringing the financing to renovate which school was this sometimes it's just helpful to like even go to their website no no it's a private school it's not a charter school it's an independent private school yeah that's doing that and because it's a church space they were like we don't have money to renovate this like we can give it a fifteen year lease but you will have to renovate it okay that's one so yeah we talked about like starting with lease and sell landowner financing lease plus like you bringing the financing but the condition is it has to be a long term lease the third one is typically like least two lease to purchase option again in first two cases also you can do like lease to purchase basically since it's a new school like it's hard to raise financing to buy the whole building but like least to purchase is is helpful because you're locking in the price today so once you get closer to your full enrollment that is the time where you basically buy it from them again two cases like if it's a commercial lender and they commercial owner and they have money they can they can do the upfront they can do the upfront construction renovation work and then build it in your purchase price at the back end but the thing is like you are basically in charge of like hey we don't want to spend more than this on renovation and this is the purchase price that we are fixing today based on your long term affordability number because one of the very recent cases i heard was like they didn't negotiate the price upfront and then in three years their board was like yeah we should probably buy the building and then seller was like asking for a very high price if that feels like this could be a long term home negotiating that that price up front is is what i've seen and then the second one is also like least to least to purchase option but like you are bringing the financing up front but you can do is like if let's say it's a one million or whatever is the number of like renovation that is required you finance it and then refinance it at the time of purchase so you you don't like let's say you're paying the lease for first five years and you have financed upfront the renovation cost and in five years you don't have to pay the whole renovation in five year term like you can amortize it over twenty five years but whatever is left for five years and the purchase price of that building you can refinance the whole thing at the back end like that's the most common model that i have seen is basically because it's very hard for a startup school to raise financing for the whole thing but like if you have the purchase option and you prove your enrollment and financial sustainability in the first four or five years then you should be able to raise like the full financing to buy the building and then refinance your renovation capital as well so those are the four types of like temp or permanent facility temp to permanent shift that i have seen the other option is also like again groups like blueprint like they do this again they they have their fees but again if it all works out for the you know like overall affordability i think that is another option to basically again as a startup school it will be difficult to raise financing but like if they finance like it's it's it's easier to get financing through them it is just that they will have some project management fee associated with it okay and then thank you for all of us and blueprint i think worked with debbie at like when she was evaluating the earlier site and they were like we don't know how this this is going to work so but like they have not been re engaged in like this new site search or this space so yeah yeah okay and in terms of i also reached out today to jane ellis and just thinking about so the work that she does versus blueprint can you give me a sense of like with offerings are there yeah so jane and ccfs they were doing so typically like when you go for this renovation financing also like a cdfi lender or a bank would only do up to a certain loan to value so banks typically do around sixty five to seventy percent cdfis go up to ninety percent loan to value but they still want ten percent to come from the school either as equity yeah mostly as equity in the project but with startup schools like they don't have that level of cash to put in as equity so what ccfs or blueprint ccf is used to do they won't they won't be doing it going forward so what they were doing was basically giving like that ten percent of sub debt which is junior to the main capital so that made banks and cdfis comfortable of like okay we can give the nine percent school doesn't have to put ten percent money upfront that sub debt is basically covering for it and at the time of purchasing the building in four or five years is when you basically refinance the whole capital stack so they bring that initial capital as a sub debt a low cost debt to basically help you raise the senior financing for this project okay so what ccfs was doing like blueprint provides that subnet to in the projects now okay okay thanks that's helpful lynn do you have any comments questions additional thinking around this just in terms of understanding where we are as grove and facilities that we've had in mind i don't think so you know i'm pretty familiar with what's out there in the market at this point in time options basically from a startup standpoint okay i guess my maybe my last question is just schools that you've seen be successful in opening in the last couple of years and what they're finding for facilities what they're doing with facilities anyone you've seen be particularly successful just getting a sense of right now the world almost feels it's not like we went from a world that was this big to this big and now i need to get somewhere around here and some of that will be with regard to the district right certainly if we decide that we prefer to be released to csi and just thinking through factors and the kind either the types of properties or just where people have been most where schools have been most successful recently the two most recent particularly in colorado yeah the two most recent examples that i think like both of those are church spaces or like one is one is actually like sharing space with another school and the other one is just a church space ok which again was a is a partnership with a church where church uses the space on sundays ok i wonder heather if it's worth connecting sidhunter should we connect tether with katie to talk about archdiocese options and just see if there are any in that area yeah i think i think that yeah that could be the other woman who's a broker with the archdiocese and they work from denver like all the way north and have hundreds of properties and she's worked with a lot of charter schools and so it's familiar with the lease to own and the scaling in that you could work on kind of charging you run a line to your enrollment as you're scaling up so i think they'd be worth just just seeing or we can ask her if they have any properties nearby and then connect to if so great absolutely katie what's your last name summer plumber with an h over okay that would be fantastic the other thing i was just going to say is you know the main thing we've learned about the last few years is that enrollment is tough in becoming more and more challenging and i know that you'll have some built in enrollment from the val community but the extent to which you can locate this school really is central to the parent base that you imagine is going to be supportive the better and i know you know that but i just it's enrollment is the thing that's going to make or break you these facilities conversations too and what we know is i mean once we lose the name recognition which we're just another school right and so we know that that is what that that if we can say fortunately brinkfield is such a strange little community with seven school districts and everything and we'd like to that's actually another downside to this space in louisville is that it's like right about twenty minutes from valswan but it's not close to any of the district boundaries which is honestly one of our our best business cases for any district right is that bellswan polls from you know seven different school districts seven to ten different school districts any given year and you know with all of the districts being concerned about declining enrollment that's something that we can actually bring right so going right into the middle of any district probably doesn't behoove us which makes room feels again you know a place that makes a lot of sense just in terms of our the business proposition that we are so regardless i hear that completely we'll be keeping that in mind anything else i appreciate the insight around we're going to continue to work the faith based networks fortunately i know somebody who's pretty well connected in those here in broomfield will continue to look at doral and feel out the opportunity there i was saying to doctor farman it just feels like right now they've got corporate staring at principals staring at board and nothing's moving so unfortunately that's a tough situation but if anything else comes to mind or comes up we're certainly all ears yeah and heather i'll check with katie and then make that connection on the thank you archdiocese speak appreciate that and all the progress is really exciting as doctor farman it's so good to meet you and just exciting there's a leader on board now for this project thank you well thank you all for your time today we really appreciate it we really do and all the information it's good to catch up to speed and thank you yeah take care y'all thank you have a good one bye bye",

so excited to hear the update i was like yay yes i'm expecting doctor farman for sure lynn may not be able to make it i believe she had to there's a family situation going on she's having to be with her grandkids and there here she is now she's coming anyway do you guys know lynn no okay i was on one of the calls with her before okay yeah okay fantastic hey lynn good afternoon everybody i wasn't talking how's everything going okay there's lots of few moving few more moving pieces but removing them so thanks cryptically glad you're and hopefully doctor fireman will be jumping in shortly in the meantime i suppose lynn it sounds as though you may not know sudachu and lydia after all is that true i don't think we met okay i wasn't their lunch at the league of charter schools conference last year okay it's good to put a voice to a name lynn thank you would you want to so lynn is our treasurer and lynn would you want to give a little bit of your background sure so i have been the executive director of operations in finance for stargate charter school for the last twenty two years so i've been with them from a four hundred fifty kid going into your first financed facility in two thousand three all the way up through this year to where they are now so lots of different experience both in day to day operations in school finance and also into starting and expanding enrollments we're now at one thousand six hundred kids k twelve and doing some additional bond construction at the school and going up with about two hundred fifty thousand square feet of k twelve space so pretty exciting stuff that's amazing and lynn are you still you're still there at stargate i'm not actually retired from that position two years ago i am now the controller for a send classical academies catalytic charter schools so i'm doing some controller work for chris scott at ascent and i've done transitional cfo work for stargate over the last couple years but really kind of tried to push them off on their own the end of fiscal twenty twenty five so i am overseeing their current construction projects because they do have this bond financing that we were lucky enough to bring in with adams twelve issue last year but that is the extent at this point in time ok great well it's good to meet you good to meet you too every time i hear lynn's background i just i kind of get a little exhausted but you clearly she's clearly the person to bring to a facilities conversation well yeah it's such great experience to have on the founding board for a new school yeah this really has been a great honor to help these help these guys move in that direction because i've done what now one two three five financing for stargate and four different major construction projects that's all awesome thank you lynn you bet hi doctor farman hello hi there sorry i'm having some technical difficulties my computer completely died i think the battery actually really fully died so i'm trying to get everything downloaded to my chromebook to be able to get on here thank you for your patience we were just going through some introductions so maybe we'll let you catch your breath and i'll move on to lydia and sudan shu since it sounds like everyone i'm the only one who knows everybody here so lydia or sudanshi would you mind introducing yourself yeah i can go and i'll be quick it's really good to meet you doctor farman and you just said hello to lynn as well my name is lydia hoffman i'm the founder and ceo of the colorado schools fund we launched this organization about a year and a half ago to really support new schools new public schools launching in colorado focused on historically underserved kids but both to provide grants and philanthropic support but also strategic support and to be sort of alongside founders and schools as they expand we have really three principles that we operate from at colorado schools fund the first is we're focused off historically underserved kids so looking at areas across the state where kids may not have access to great schools today the second is we have a really high bar for quality so we're a little crazy about for schools that exist already what their student outcomes and performance like and purdue schools their plan and the leadership to get to a really strong place for students and then the third thing is we're supporting schools that are opening in partnership with their local communities and really driven by family demand so not schools that are sort of just plopping down but ones that are really filling a need in a certain community and my background i spent twelve years an organization called the charter school growth fund which is a national foundation that supports the growth and expansion of high performing charter schools all over the country and i'm based in denver and have two boys of my own ages five and seven so we're at the early elementary years ourselves right now with kindergarten and second grade but it's great to meet you soon after you i'll turn it over to you yeah thanks lydia doctor fowman didn't nice to meet you i am sudanshu and started working with last year at colorado schools fund as we launched my role as lilia explained we support charter schools as they open as they launch and grow my role is also around like supporting the schools around finance facilities and all the other areas coordinating support from our extended team or consultants that we work with prior to that i was at charter school growth fund worked on the grants team and then also spent half of the time there on structured finance team where we were supporting schools on new schools on facilities and then also underwriting some of the creative loan structures to support early stage schools to get access to financing for their facilities and then prior to that i worked in india with a venture capital fund doing ed tech investments both in k twelve and workforce development space and taught in a public school for two years math and pretty much all subjects except their regional language so yeah had some spent some time in the classroom and lot of lot of great learnings from there i love hearing both of your backgrounds i think we've started with debbie and then i came in and we were kind of in the midst of the last application i don't know that i ever fully got your background so i'm so glad we took a moment for this yeah and doctor farman if you want to introduce yourself and just for context i can't i can't even completely verbalize what a game changer it has been to have doctor farm in the home board bringing all of her k five expertise and leadership and we're just so grateful she's here so go ahead doctor i feel like i can never really live up to the compliments but thank you well it's nice to meet both of you i'm doctor susan marie farman i am a first generation american a first generation high school and college graduate and i aged out of the farsis system and i share that because i have historically throughout my career worked with historically marginalized populations either through the special education process and then also with intersectionalities of identity so students who we know that students who are linguistically diverse or students who come from positionalities of poverty or different status of different phases of their status of seeking citizenship here so i've served in newcomer communities they tend to be over identified in special education populations as well and so i've done a lot of work and presentation on the oprah representation of linguistically diverse students students of color and students who are associates economically disadvantaged so it's always just been an important part of my service and my work i started out in center based programs for spirit and program students in seattle and when i moved here to colorado in two thousand seven i started working in denver public schools i've worked in innovation schools charter schools general public school settings but i've gravitated mostly toward places where there were intersectionalities of identities so i worked at place bridge academy for a few years where i could do translation work but also support work for people who are new to american education systems having navigated those myself it's always on my heart to support people to navigate those systems and then that wasn't enough i decided i needed a year supporting adjudicated youth to navigate post secondary systems which is a very interesting endeavor over this last year i was the executive director of a chartering jeffco for a couple of years helping them to kind of rebrand and recenter their school and i also am an adjunct for the university of colorado it teacher graduate course there for human resource management and staff development for them specifically they brought me on a couple of years ago they wanted someone with experience helping leaders to serve diverse populations of staff but also diverse populations of students and so it's been really just an honor to get to do that work and teach leaders how to lead people who may look and sound and be different than them culturally linguistically and economically religiously all of those things and this was especially exciting to me to think about serving the needs of students in a different way and being able to support in ways that we know students need but i don't know that typical public schools can always name right there's just a lot within typical educational settings that you can't address in a way that you can address when you're a charter and so i love the work of being able to shift the need and the budget and the support and the staffing model to fit what you actually need to do for your community so that's kind of just a little nutshell there i've been in colorado since two thousand seven and like i said we moved here from seattle but i've lived all over the country and we travel all over the world and have a deep appreciation for education in any setting great to me too thanks for sharing all that yeah so we can share a little bit and thanks everybody for the brief introductions just wanted to make sure everybody has a chance to get to know one another in addition we can share a little bit about the progress that we've made i went back and looked and i think it was early may was the last time that we had the opportunity to meet and it's just been significant progress in a variety of areas since that point in time i can start out talking a little bit about the governance piece if doctor farman you want to touch on some of the education plans and maybe even some of the messaging component speaking of messaging it was really fun yesterday we were back out in the community finally doing some outreach we revised our intent to enroll and we have our first few intent to enroll sign up so it's exciting to be starting again and it just feels really really good to be back out in the community and talking with folks and they're still super supportive and excited that road is still coming i can speak a little bit to the governance piece and that's something that we're partnering with debbie around so at this point in time we're looking at developing kind of an interim agreement with valswan children's center that recognizing what it means to be a bell swan school and that's something that doctor farman and debbie i think debbie is so grateful to have somebody she can speak apples to apples with now in terms of you know approaches what have you but across early childhood and k five but they put together they have put together some of the components that would be included in being a belong school which we've been asking for for a while and we're just really grateful that that's coming we know that there is interest and likely intention of developing a foundation of some sort that will provide support i'm really hopeful that it's going to focus for sure on research and data collection but then also some potential for fundraising support and that will be a little longer in coming but in the in the meantime we've recognized the importance of being able to say this is the relationship between val swan children's center and grove elementary school not only to make the public and private very clearly separate but also to demonstrate the alignment because we know that that's where the vision and the mission really originated and the approach in making sure that those components are clear so that should be finalized i would say within the next month or so and we'll have that agreement ready to and i know bell swan is also working with an attorney making sure that they're thinking clearly about what needs to go what kind of relationship that needs to be likely something that is more binding than an lu and we may also be providing a fee of some sort to bell swan children center for that support lynn un muted well i was just i was just curious just kind of in layman's terms like how based on where you landed what the what the relationship will look like or what bel swan will be providing or vice versa in terms of what they're providing that's really the next component and the piece that we need to finalize doctor farman i don't know if you'd want to speak to i can pull up with debbie sent me but i wasn't a part of that conversation in terms of the approach and what needs to be included in that approach is that something you'd be able to speak to yeah i think well she's still kind of trying to develop what that's gonna look like i think what she's figuring out is for val swan they know what they do at the ece level what they're trying to figure out because they're as debbie shared with me she's not an elementary school specialist and so for them understanding what it means to be a standards based school and following colorado academic standards and meeting those but within this idea of supporting students in these other ways and so what we've come up with is a framework of working alongside of castles competencies castle the organization for social and emotional learning and really comin ourselves to this foundational component of what it looks like to center that as opposed to it being this sort of peripheral add on so if that's the central tenet of what we're doing as a school then everything else kind of falling in line with that whether it's the curricular options that we've chosen in which case our el rea materials align not only with castle because their castle endorsed and they align with that but also it aligns with the workshop model which we believe is more conducive to students being able to meet their needs in a classroom being able to have small autonomy some space some opportunity for inquiry but also the evidence points to teachers being able to have a little bit more time for intervention time within that structure so everything we've done has sort of cascaded off of that piece in working with debbie i met with her last week to talk about what are the attributes then that we've identified you know that we wanna make sure that we're carefully picking who it is that we align with this work it can't be a teacher that doesn't have any training in special education for example we would want teachers who have some understanding of what it means to be dedicated to social and emotional learning that's still a fairly new area in education in terms of teacher prep programs for example incorporating that into what they do and so that was some of our conversation is what do we need to call out when we're looking for staff to staff a school like this we're looking for people who understand that this isn't a space where voice and choice come off the table if anything we wanna augment student voice and choice that's something that i often have to provide a lot of training for my staff around just in general so what does that look like in a school that's more of a mild moderate setting as a rule in my conversations with the special education director for jeffco one of the things we talked about is believing that there's a space between general education environments and center based programming right we often see that for students who have an iep but we also know there are a lot of students who don't need the educational need for an iep but they still have some pretty significant needs and yes we can give students a five hundred four there are also a lot of families that would just like some support for their children with or without labels what can we do to better support kids within the school setting and so that's what debbie and i are starting to work on right now is so what does that look like what does it mean to staff it what does it mean to support it what is the structures that need to be in place look like what do we name them what does that consistency look like from one place to another and so that's what the conversation that we started last week was really just naming what i call the attributes of the school the attributes of the staff what are the systems and structures that we then create around that to make it look that way i know what the educational programming will look like for grove and i vetted that out and that's almost complete in our application at this point i'm just naming the finishing touches on special education components of that but in looking at that for if belswan was wanting to say hey in order to replicate this what are some key components that someone would need doesn't matter if they follow the same curriculum but having a workshop model really lends itself to that and so that's something i think they need to name if you're going to have an educational setting like this having something like responsive classroom for example is the overarching social and emotional learning support for the entire structure staff and students of the school so you've got to have a school that we'd be dedicated to treating staff in a way that they are role models for student behavior and student expectations so those are just a couple of things i don't want to get into too much detail but those were some of the things that we started to name as attributes does that help a little bit yeah it's helpful and it's also helpful just to understand that sounds like you're still early in the process too of figuring that out which makes sense and the other piece of this that debbie and i have chatted about is really the commitment to developing grove and really developing the model the shared model together and recognizing that yes belle has clearly has a sense of how this is implemented and what the approach is grove is going to hold a whole lot of expertise knowledge and understanding of what needs like what are the non negotiables it's kind of how we've talked about them in the past in terms of a k five setting and making those mesh because belle swan doesn't have that and so recognizing that as we were thinking through like well does grove just become a school of belle swan or do we develop this such that it's kind of a sister or school approach recognizing that there's going to grove is not going to be able to hold the expertise of a k five nor a public school and so that is really something that we're looking at how do we build that into an agreement such that we are working in tandem that it is a partnership still separate but it is a partnership that we are forging together and so that's a definite other piece that we're developing so with that there's the governance peace doctor farming got into a little bit of education plan work there are several components of the next application that will not be district contingent that doctor farman has already completed is working through things that were really overwhelming for us last time in terms of things like waivers and i told doctor farman when she sent me a completed initial draft of the waivers i'm like i remember getting that last time in like opening it and then closing it because it was just really really overwhelming for somebody who was new to charter schools and she's like no i think you know this is what we're gonna need and we can revisit it but you know this is this is the starting point it was like be still my heart so there are several components of the application that are already moving forward and i wanna pause doctor harmon is there anything else that you wanted to add just in terms of that progress or is it okay to move into district and facilities yeah i think that's okay i think the pieces we've covered are the good okay so we reached out in part because we wanted you to have an opportunity to meet doctor farman and also as may not be surprising to you our biggest challenge at this point in time is really facilities and as we've been looking at our options once we took a new building on the site of belle swan children center off the table the world opened up a little bit and because there were some assumptions that were made from the very beginning that's where the school would be maybe we'd have a temporary situation but it was always bdsd and once we took that off the table suddenly the world looks a little bigger and the real estate agent we were working with was really happy but we looked initially at we looked initially at some districts that touched broomfield right because we recognized that bellswan does have roots in the broomfield community and that might be a really important piece so there's adams twelve still boulder ballet school district there's jeff ko we talked a little bit about st brain but decided it might be a little bit of a far reach and more recently even though it's not technically a broom field district we just met with district fifty or i'm sorry not district it used to be district fifty i keep doing that because i used to work in adams county it's a westminster right so in the end i think what we're looking at is how can we identify or let's identify a radius of about a twenty minute drive from valswangeld's center recognizing that that's the center of our network and drop off schedules are everything right if you've got a kiddo who needs to be dropped off at belswan you're not gonna want to drive into boulder to drop off another child right so looking at it could be several of those districts but how do we create that radius and look at facilities that are within that sphere so looking at where we are now in terms of facilities we have one building in jefferson and jeco public schools that is a current charter environment i'm not sure if we've talked with you at all about this but looking at dural academy they have some space right now and trying to forge a partnership there where we might be able to use some of that space that would be wonderful and it's complicated given the status of the current school another thing that we've been looking at there's actually a church that is currently for sale in louisville so it's not a pinot where davidson mesa is not far off of highway thirty six this would be back in bbsd there's a church facility that's in land that are for sale we reached out to see if they would consider leasing they don't want to at this moment in time but we're kind of keeping that in the back of our minds that that is something that could definitely work otherwise i think what we're grappling with and where we've said you know we need some additional expertise obviously lynn's been down the construction road quite a bit but where we're looking for some additional expertise is really thinking about renovation it's an area that you know i think historically we've preferred to see if we could find other facilities where that would be necessary increasingly it seems as though that's an option that we need to consider as we look at the facilities that are available and what the options are and i think that's where we have a little bit of a knowledge gap in terms of the resources that are available and what the potential would be within our time frame of renovating an existing space and if there are for example certain spaces that are better lynn several times over has said churches are great for this and so we have reached out through faith based networks within the immediate area we haven't heard anything back at this point in time but keeping fingers crossed just looking for any expertise resources advice that you could offer in terms of facilities and some of these options that we've found yeah happy to talk through that we have worked on lot of leasehold tenant improvements renovations and again like for startup schools like that's the strategy that we also recommend to have like more leased options or like least two own options but before i jump into that curious on and again like this is like a three dimensional chess that each school who is looking to launch has to play is around facilities as the driver for where to launch or where do where can we get authorized and figure out a facility so i'm just curious like because again like the dynamics of each of the districts that you named are very different in terms of like ability to get authorized so just curious like how you're thinking about the trade off there in terms of westminster fifty versus adams fourteen verses adams fourteen i think is very difficult but otherwise like all the other jets so yeah fourteen would be a little bit far reached but it's a good question i think what we're increasingly hearing is that charter authorization is a bit of an undertaking regardless of where you go and in terms of the relative differences between districts it seems as though every time we ask about another district like with the league like tell us what you know what's going on here it's it's not it's never a real positive message and so i think honestly we're kind of in the in this sphere of one thing that we are considering and i'm reaching out to csi this week with bvsd released a csi was never even on the table so wanting to reach out to them revisit that potential in that conversation because that could tip us one way or another right if we really dive in to csi it seems like a great direction for us to go then it might be it might be worth consider you know considering one district over another at this point in time if we are looking at our preference really is to be an asset to a district to partner with a district and be an asset i'm not saying huge and tell me if you see something different but from what i've gotten across these districts there are relative advantages and disadvantages but they tend to kind of cancel each other out and what we are feeling fairly certain of is that grove is going to do well regardless of where we put it because in part because of our connection to belle swan being a known quantity our approach and having some fairly you know having a fair amount of reassurance that you know this model is something that's desired among families we anticipate it doing well in just about any setting as long as we stay close enough to valswan that said i am open to other thinking around this and again if we meet with csi and suddenly it seems like ok this is a direction we want to go then that changes matters go ahead lydia yeah i was just gonna say i'm just gonna close my door real quick but i am still listening ok i think the csi path makes a ton of sense to consider for the set of districts that are on your list when i think of adams twelve westminster boulder dress girl jeffco's lego yeah and jeffco's like maybe the one with of those the best chance but it still has a lot of turmoil going on right now and so i think the csi release is definitely gonna be the best path if you can figure out how that might work and i think terry will probably have a good sense of those districts is there one that may be willing to release you more than others i know in coming on what i heard from people and i think sudan sus might answer your question too is what i heard when i came on board is people felt such a strong values alliance with bdsd it was very clear that people had developed some relationships there but there was real values alignment and so that was hard obviously when the rejection of the first application happened and people were gearing up to want to do that again but then there wasn't a building of available the reason this shift to jeff cocaine is like heather said the jarrell building we think is an opportunity but it's such an awkward lynn and i met earlier today and we were talking about the logistics of that so darrell owns the building but they don't own the land that it's on but there's also some other things that i think from a building leadership point of view would be really also kind of sticky for us if it were to happen that we got authorized i think there would be some ongoing concerns about the building in general academica i think is the manager but also is the company that built that space for jerrell to be there and what ended up happening was i think a lot of the work that needed to be done in the community before that building was built maybe didn't happen and so it wasn't a desired location for a school as far as the housing community and folks who live there were probably concerned in the homeowners association so there's some stickiness there but then the other layer of that is whether or not that school is going to continue or not and if a partnership is really even feasible in their current state because they were k twelve then they went down to a k eight right now they feel like they do middle school better than elementary but they're not sure that their board is open and it sounds like they're missing more than half of their board members right now with their most recent president resigning last week and so we don't know there's just so much up in the air in the meantime we're trying to complete an application to submit it somewhere and so that's what's tricky too so it does feel like our facility is driving a lot of this just because we do need a place to be it would be nice if we were in the situation where we had a building in each of those places and then we could say oh well our values are most aligned here i did meet with someone for quite some time two folks actually from jeffco and it sounded like from the conversation that we had what they would want is a reassert assurance that we would be sensitive to their current situation of lowered enrollment and closing twenty one schools and the other piece that they would want to make sure that we were one hundred percent not a burden on the district in any capacity that we were fully sustainable financially and that we were nothing but a value add yes that's always the best case scenario and i still may need your technical support team to help me with my website or whatever so i can't say that we would never need any of the services that we would need but i also think they wanted to make sure especially in terms of special education that we were really closely aligned so that was the bulk of our conversation was talking about where we could be a value add in that space without us becoming a center based program which it sounds like they're not really looking for any way so in working closely with them i think if we were to pursue jeffco it would just be a constant stream of mutual communication going back and forth about that to make sure we were pretty tightly aligned in what would best support the district as well for kind of a mutual benefit and a reasonable but terrell was really the reason that we did consider jeffco because it's like you know particularly from a budget standpoint you know bbsd on the surface certainly looks you know like a better option that said there's just nothing there there's just nothing there in terms of facilities that we've been able now if we can renovate if we can get a wrap our brains around renovation a little bit and we could look at there are interesting facilities they just need a fair amount of work to become a school jeffco obviously from a budget standpoint not as appealing but on the other hand there's a building we're willing to consider it honestly i really kind of appreciated the conversation with westminster i'm kind of surprised that we didn't consider that previously it seems as though they may be more likely for a csi release or at least historically that's been their tendency with finding enrollment we have yet to talk to their liaison it was just somebody that i know who does administration at westminster public school so we still need to have a more in depth conversation adams twelve is still on the table both from csi perspective as well as ageists never know there might be buildings there so it's really difficult with the facilities challenge to rule out anybody at this at this point but we think we have a pretty good sense of what our criteria are in terms of csi local funding facilities the political climate like i said if you can give me a sense of don't go there on any of the districts we can definitely consider that it just doesn't it seems like it's a little bit of an uphill battle regardless of where we go i mean and rightfully so right i mean look at the federal situation alone is kind of is a lot so more than open though to your perspective on districts if there's somebody we should rule out or we should more heavily consider yeah i would just say when i said three dimensional chess so one part of it was facilities the part was authorization and the third big part is also enrollment so i think that is something that we also look at when we are thinking about like new schools to like what's the enrollment potential for that particular property because that is again the big driver for like long term sustainability so that just name that also and then i would say on the facility side the spaces that you have looked at or the church spaces or other tim or like spaces that require innovation like are these all up for sale or these are like are these like leads to purchase option or like some some kind of a structure where yeah there's a variety that are out there i don't at this moment in time even feel like i have enough of a sense of what's possible okay in order to really pursue or look at any of them some of them might be least to owe that might be an option for all i know in the church might even be an option that way that would put us back at bbse regardless yeah i just it would just be great to have a sense of like okay should you go down the renovation road there are resources there are not resources you'd have to fundraise you know just having a sense of yeah okay factors no that's helpful so i can then just talk about like what are the different types of not grounds up build but what kind of other facility solutions that we have supported charters with so like the first thing is to start with like understanding the affordability so looking at like in our school budget like on an annual basis we should be able to spend let's say ten percent of your revenue on facilities again typically charters spend around ten to twelve percent but again knowing like groves model that is a number to be tested because some of the schools that were serving high needs student population that i worked with in texas couldn't spend like twelve percent towards that so they were only able to spend like six seven percent at max so just making sure that we understand that number clearly because that then will give us like okay this is the maximum annually we can spend in terms of facilities rent or dead service so once we have that number clarity and we can just do it on the steady state like let's say three hundred student or two hundred fifty students school this is annually was what we are going to spend once we have that number we can basically then like that's a good starting point to start having conversations with folks or the properties that you are evaluating to say that so and then i'll talk about different structures so one is a simple structure where like you have a long term lease but that space requires renovation right so now if it's a commercial space like a strip mall or like a space that you're converting in that case like those are more commercial owners that own that space so for them like there is an incentive to upkeep that space and like maintain it so in those cases i've seen like seller has done or like the the landowner has done the financing for some of the improvements either one hundred percent or have done it in partnership with this school like school raises some money and then fifty percent comes from seller financing so that landowner financing for their renovation cost but making sure that and then they basically whatever loan that they are taking or money that source of capital that they have they basically build it in your lease total amount so negotiating a lease to like hey this is the maximum we can pay and then this is what it would yeah this is the maximum we can pay so whatever the actual lease amount is and all the new construction that would be like it should all add up to like that maximum amount is what you can negotiate with them so so seller financing plus long term lease is is what the common structure couple of schools in aurora and other places have done that both either with church or with or with commercial owners as well and is is that a a model that schools that have opened recently are using or is that something that is five plus years since you've seen that the landscape feels like it's changed so much that i just want to be sure that we're pursuing options that have been used recently yeah no i think these are the options that are that are still like eligible like so again like that's the starting point of your negotiation to ask landowner to finance to to make sure like because you're not owning the space you're leaning the space you're leasing the space so like it's basically like you wouldn't want to spend money in upgrading it and then ten years down the line if again like if it's it's minor innovations and like if it's not too much like and it the budget for lease plus renovation is within your affordability range then you can you can do all the financing yourself and like not but the only condition in that in in that is that it has to be a long term lease like for you to raise financing at least require like ten to fifteen years of lease term for you to be able to finance that because like lenders typically don't finance the term of financing is not beyond the lease term of the the space so negotiating the longer lease term is is what i've seen folks do and this is again a recent example from the springs where colorado springs where it's a it's a lease option but school is bringing the financing to renovate which school was this sometimes it's just helpful to like even go to their website no no it's a private school it's not a charter school it's an independent private school yeah that's doing that and because it's a church space they were like we don't have money to renovate this like we can give it a fifteen year lease but you will have to renovate it okay that's one so yeah we talked about like starting with lease and sell landowner financing lease plus like you bringing the financing but the condition is it has to be a long term lease the third one is typically like least two lease to purchase option again in first two cases also you can do like lease to purchase basically since it's a new school like it's hard to raise financing to buy the whole building but like least to purchase is is helpful because you're locking in the price today so once you get closer to your full enrollment that is the time where you basically buy it from them again two cases like if it's a commercial lender and they commercial owner and they have money they can they can do the upfront they can do the upfront construction renovation work and then build it in your purchase price at the back end but the thing is like you are basically in charge of like hey we don't want to spend more than this on renovation and this is the purchase price that we are fixing today based on your long term affordability number because one of the very recent cases i heard was like they didn't negotiate the price upfront and then in three years their board was like yeah we should probably buy the building and then seller was like asking for a very high price if that feels like this could be a long term home negotiating that that price up front is is what i've seen and then the second one is also like least to least to purchase option but like you are bringing the financing up front but you can do is like if let's say it's a one million or whatever is the number of like renovation that is required you finance it and then refinance it at the time of purchase so you you don't like let's say you're paying the lease for first five years and you have financed upfront the renovation cost and in five years you don't have to pay the whole renovation in five year term like you can amortize it over twenty five years but whatever is left for five years and the purchase price of that building you can refinance the whole thing at the back end like that's the most common model that i have seen is basically because it's very hard for a startup school to raise financing for the whole thing but like if you have the purchase option and you prove your enrollment and financial sustainability in the first four or five years then you should be able to raise like the full financing to buy the building and then refinance your renovation capital as well so those are the four types of like temp or permanent facility temp to permanent shift that i have seen the other option is also like again groups like blueprint like they do this again they they have their fees but again if it all works out for the you know like overall affordability i think that is another option to basically again as a startup school it will be difficult to raise financing but like if they finance like it's it's it's easier to get financing through them it is just that they will have some project management fee associated with it okay and then thank you for all of us and blueprint i think worked with debbie at like when she was evaluating the earlier site and they were like we don't know how this this is going to work so but like they have not been re engaged in like this new site search or this space so yeah yeah okay and in terms of i also reached out today to jane ellis and just thinking about so the work that she does versus blueprint can you give me a sense of like with offerings are there yeah so jane and ccfs they were doing so typically like when you go for this renovation financing also like a cdfi lender or a bank would only do up to a certain loan to value so banks typically do around sixty five to seventy percent cdfis go up to ninety percent loan to value but they still want ten percent to come from the school either as equity yeah mostly as equity in the project but with startup schools like they don't have that level of cash to put in as equity so what ccfs or blueprint ccf is used to do they won't they won't be doing it going forward so what they were doing was basically giving like that ten percent of sub debt which is junior to the main capital so that made banks and cdfis comfortable of like okay we can give the nine percent school doesn't have to put ten percent money upfront that sub debt is basically covering for it and at the time of purchasing the building in four or five years is when you basically refinance the whole capital stack so they bring that initial capital as a sub debt a low cost debt to basically help you raise the senior financing for this project okay so what ccfs was doing like blueprint provides that subnet to in the projects now okay okay thanks that's helpful lynn do you have any comments questions additional thinking around this just in terms of understanding where we are as grove and facilities that we've had in mind i don't think so you know i'm pretty familiar with what's out there in the market at this point in time options basically from a startup standpoint okay i guess my maybe my last question is just schools that you've seen be successful in opening in the last couple of years and what they're finding for facilities what they're doing with facilities anyone you've seen be particularly successful just getting a sense of right now the world almost feels it's not like we went from a world that was this big to this big and now i need to get somewhere around here and some of that will be with regard to the district right certainly if we decide that we prefer to be released to csi and just thinking through factors and the kind either the types of properties or just where people have been most where schools have been most successful recently the two most recent particularly in colorado yeah the two most recent examples that i think like both of those are church spaces or like one is one is actually like sharing space with another school and the other one is just a church space ok which again was a is a partnership with a church where church uses the space on sundays ok i wonder heather if it's worth connecting sidhunter should we connect tether with katie to talk about archdiocese options and just see if there are any in that area yeah i think i think that yeah that could be the other woman who's a broker with the archdiocese and they work from denver like all the way north and have hundreds of properties and she's worked with a lot of charter schools and so it's familiar with the lease to own and the scaling in that you could work on kind of charging you run a line to your enrollment as you're scaling up so i think they'd be worth just just seeing or we can ask her if they have any properties nearby and then connect to if so great absolutely katie what's your last name summer plumber with an h over okay that would be fantastic the other thing i was just going to say is you know the main thing we've learned about the last few years is that enrollment is tough in becoming more and more challenging and i know that you'll have some built in enrollment from the val community but the extent to which you can locate this school really is central to the parent base that you imagine is going to be supportive the better and i know you know that but i just it's enrollment is the thing that's going to make or break you these facilities conversations too and what we know is i mean once we lose the name recognition which we're just another school right and so we know that that is what that that if we can say fortunately brinkfield is such a strange little community with seven school districts and everything and we'd like to that's actually another downside to this space in louisville is that it's like right about twenty minutes from valswan but it's not close to any of the district boundaries which is honestly one of our our best business cases for any district right is that bellswan polls from you know seven different school districts seven to ten different school districts any given year and you know with all of the districts being concerned about declining enrollment that's something that we can actually bring right so going right into the middle of any district probably doesn't behoove us which makes room feels again you know a place that makes a lot of sense just in terms of our the business proposition that we are so regardless i hear that completely we'll be keeping that in mind anything else i appreciate the insight around we're going to continue to work the faith based networks fortunately i know somebody who's pretty well connected in those here in broomfield will continue to look at doral and feel out the opportunity there i was saying to doctor farman it just feels like right now they've got corporate staring at principals staring at board and nothing's moving so unfortunately that's a tough situation but if anything else comes to mind or comes up we're certainly all ears yeah and heather i'll check with katie and then make that connection on the thank you archdiocese speak appreciate that and all the progress is really exciting as doctor farman it's so good to meet you and just exciting there's a leader on board now for this project thank you well thank you all for your time today we really appreciate it we really do and all the information it's good to catch up to speed and thank you yeah take care y'all thank you have a good one bye bye",

she's headed in hi lydia good how are you good good to see i know it's been a little while i know i know we've been in transition mode and i think we're emerging that's exciting right you're telling me i'm so excited to hear the update i was like yay yes i'm expecting doctor farman for sure lynn may not be able to make it i believe she had to there's a family situation going on she's having to be with her grandkids and there here she is now she's coming anyway do you guys know lynn no okay i was on one of the calls with her before okay yeah okay fantastic hey lynn good afternoon everybody i wasn't talking how's everything going okay there's lots of few moving few more moving pieces but removing them so thanks cryptically glad you're and hopefully doctor fireman will be jumping in shortly in the meantime i suppose lynn it sounds as though you may not know sudachu and lydia after all is that true i don't think we met okay i wasn't their lunch at the league of charter schools conference last year okay it's good to put a voice to a name lynn thank you would you want to so lynn is our treasurer and lynn would you want to give a little bit of your background sure so i have been the executive director of operations in finance for stargate charter school for the last twenty two years so i've been with them from a four hundred fifty kid going into your first financed facility in two thousand three all the way up through this year to where they are now so lots of different experience both in day to day operations in school finance and also into starting and expanding enrollments we're now at one thousand six hundred kids k twelve and doing some additional bond construction at the school and going up with about two hundred fifty thousand square feet of k twelve space so pretty exciting stuff that's amazing and lynn are you still you're still there at stargate i'm not actually retired from that position two years ago i am now the controller for a send classical academies catalytic charter schools so i'm doing some controller work for chris scott at ascent and i've done transitional cfo work for stargate over the last couple years but really kind of tried to push them off on their own the end of fiscal twenty twenty five so i am overseeing their current construction projects because they do have this bond financing that we were lucky enough to bring in with adams twelve issue last year but that is the extent at this point in time ok great well it's good to meet you good to meet you too every time i hear lynn's background i just i kind of get a little exhausted but you clearly she's clearly the person to bring to a facilities conversation well yeah it's such great experience to have on the founding board for a new school yeah this really has been a great honor to help these help these guys move in that direction because i've done what now one two three five financing for stargate and four different major construction projects that's all awesome thank you lynn you bet hi doctor farman hello hi there sorry i'm having some technical difficulties my computer completely died i think the battery actually really fully died so i'm trying to get everything downloaded to my chromebook to be able to get on here thank you for your patience we were just going through some introductions so maybe we'll let you catch your breath and i'll move on to lydia and sudan shu since it sounds like everyone i'm the only one who knows everybody here so lydia or sudanshi would you mind introducing yourself yeah i can go and i'll be quick it's really good to meet you doctor farman and you just said hello to lynn as well my name is lydia hoffman i'm the founder and ceo of the colorado schools fund we launched this organization about a year and a half ago to really support new schools new public schools launching in colorado focused on historically underserved kids but both to provide grants and philanthropic support but also strategic support and to be sort of alongside founders and schools as they expand we have really three principles that we operate from at colorado schools fund the first is we're focused off historically underserved kids so looking at areas across the state where kids may not have access to great schools today the second is we have a really high bar for quality so we're a little crazy about for schools that exist already what their student outcomes and performance like and purdue schools their plan and the leadership to get to a really strong place for students and then the third thing is we're supporting schools that are opening in partnership with their local communities and really driven by family demand so not schools that are sort of just plopping down but ones that are really filling a need in a certain community and my background i spent twelve years an organization called the charter school growth fund which is a national foundation that supports the growth and expansion of high performing charter schools all over the country and i'm based in denver and have two boys of my own ages five and seven so we're at the early elementary years ourselves right now with kindergarten and second grade but it's great to meet you soon after you i'll turn it over to you yeah thanks lydia doctor fowman didn't nice to meet you i am sudanshu and started working with last year at colorado schools fund as we launched my role as lilia explained we support charter schools as they open as they launch and grow my role is also around like supporting the schools around finance facilities and all the other areas coordinating support from our extended team or consultants that we work with prior to that i was at charter school growth fund worked on the grants team and then also spent half of the time there on structured finance team where we were supporting schools on new schools on facilities and then also underwriting some of the creative loan structures to support early stage schools to get access to financing for their facilities and then prior to that i worked in india with a venture capital fund doing ed tech investments both in k twelve and workforce development space and taught in a public school for two years math and pretty much all subjects except their regional language so yeah had some spent some time in the classroom and lot of lot of great learnings from there i love hearing both of your backgrounds i think we've started with debbie and then i came in and we were kind of in the midst of the last application i don't know that i ever fully got your background so i'm so glad we took a moment for this yeah and doctor farman if you want to introduce yourself and just for context i can't i can't even completely verbalize what a game changer it has been to have doctor farm in the home board bringing all of her k five expertise and leadership and we're just so grateful she's here so go ahead doctor i feel like i can never really live up to the compliments but thank you well it's nice to meet both of you i'm doctor susan marie farman i am a first generation american a first generation high school and college graduate and i aged out of the farsis system and i share that because i have historically throughout my career worked with historically marginalized populations either through the special education process and then also with intersectionalities of identity so students who we know that students who are linguistically diverse or students who come from positionalities of poverty or different status of different phases of their status of seeking citizenship here so i've served in newcomer communities they tend to be over identified in special education populations as well and so i've done a lot of work and presentation on the oprah representation of linguistically diverse students students of color and students who are associates economically disadvantaged so it's always just been an important part of my service and my work i started out in center based programs for spirit and program students in seattle and when i moved here to colorado in two thousand seven i started working in denver public schools i've worked in innovation schools charter schools general public school settings but i've gravitated mostly toward places where there were intersectionalities of identities so i worked at place bridge academy for a few years where i could do translation work but also support work for people who are new to american education systems having navigated those myself it's always on my heart to support people to navigate those systems and then that wasn't enough i decided i needed a year supporting adjudicated youth to navigate post secondary systems which is a very interesting endeavor over this last year i was the executive director of a chartering jeffco for a couple of years helping them to kind of rebrand and recenter their school and i also am an adjunct for the university of colorado it teacher graduate course there for human resource management and staff development for them specifically they brought me on a couple of years ago they wanted someone with experience helping leaders to serve diverse populations of staff but also diverse populations of students and so it's been really just an honor to get to do that work and teach leaders how to lead people who may look and sound and be different than them culturally linguistically and economically religiously all of those things and this was especially exciting to me to think about serving the needs of students in a different way and being able to support in ways that we know students need but i don't know that typical public schools can always name right there's just a lot within typical educational settings that you can't address in a way that you can address when you're a charter and so i love the work of being able to shift the need and the budget and the support and the staffing model to fit what you actually need to do for your community so that's kind of just a little nutshell there i've been in colorado since two thousand seven and like i said we moved here from seattle but i've lived all over the country and we travel all over the world and have a deep appreciation for education in any setting great to me too thanks for sharing all that yeah so we can share a little bit and thanks everybody for the brief introductions just wanted to make sure everybody has a chance to get to know one another in addition we can share a little bit about the progress that we've made i went back and looked and i think it was early may was the last time that we had the opportunity to meet and it's just been significant progress in a variety of areas since that point in time i can start out talking a little bit about the governance piece if doctor farman you want to touch on some of the education plans and maybe even some of the messaging component speaking of messaging it was really fun yesterday we were back out in the community finally doing some outreach we revised our intent to enroll and we have our first few intent to enroll sign up so it's exciting to be starting again and it just feels really really good to be back out in the community and talking with folks and they're still super supportive and excited that road is still coming i can speak a little bit to the governance piece and that's something that we're partnering with debbie around so at this point in time we're looking at developing kind of an interim agreement with valswan children's center that recognizing what it means to be a bell swan school and that's something that doctor farman and debbie i think debbie is so grateful to have somebody she can speak apples to apples with now in terms of you know approaches what have you but across early childhood and k five but they put together they have put together some of the components that would be included in being a belong school which we've been asking for for a while and we're just really grateful that that's coming we know that there is interest and likely intention of developing a foundation of some sort that will provide support i'm really hopeful that it's going to focus for sure on research and data collection but then also some potential for fundraising support and that will be a little longer in coming but in the in the meantime we've recognized the importance of being able to say this is the relationship between val swan children's center and grove elementary school not only to make the public and private very clearly separate but also to demonstrate the alignment because we know that that's where the vision and the mission really originated and the approach in making sure that those components are clear so that should be finalized i would say within the next month or so and we'll have that agreement ready to and i know bell swan is also working with an attorney making sure that they're thinking clearly about what needs to go what kind of relationship that needs to be likely something that is more binding than an lu and we may also be providing a fee of some sort to bell swan children center for that support lynn un muted well i was just i was just curious just kind of in layman's terms like how based on where you landed what the what the relationship will look like or what bel swan will be providing or vice versa in terms of what they're providing that's really the next component and the piece that we need to finalize doctor farman i don't know if you'd want to speak to i can pull up with debbie sent me but i wasn't a part of that conversation in terms of the approach and what needs to be included in that approach is that something you'd be able to speak to yeah i think well she's still kind of trying to develop what that's gonna look like i think what she's figuring out is for val swan they know what they do at the ece level what they're trying to figure out because they're as debbie shared with me she's not an elementary school specialist and so for them understanding what it means to be a standards based school and following colorado academic standards and meeting those but within this idea of supporting students in these other ways and so what we've come up with is a framework of working alongside of castles competencies castle the organization for social and emotional learning and really comin ourselves to this foundational component of what it looks like to center that as opposed to it being this sort of peripheral add on so if that's the central tenet of what we're doing as a school then everything else kind of falling in line with that whether it's the curricular options that we've chosen in which case our el rea materials align not only with castle because their castle endorsed and they align with that but also it aligns with the workshop model which we believe is more conducive to students being able to meet their needs in a classroom being able to have small autonomy some space some opportunity for inquiry but also the evidence points to teachers being able to have a little bit more time for intervention time within that structure so everything we've done has sort of cascaded off of that piece in working with debbie i met with her last week to talk about what are the attributes then that we've identified you know that we wanna make sure that we're carefully picking who it is that we align with this work it can't be a teacher that doesn't have any training in special education for example we would want teachers who have some understanding of what it means to be dedicated to social and emotional learning that's still a fairly new area in education in terms of teacher prep programs for example incorporating that into what they do and so that was some of our conversation is what do we need to call out when we're looking for staff to staff a school like this we're looking for people who understand that this isn't a space where voice and choice come off the table if anything we wanna augment student voice and choice that's something that i often have to provide a lot of training for my staff around just in general so what does that look like in a school that's more of a mild moderate setting as a rule in my conversations with the special education director for jeffco one of the things we talked about is believing that there's a space between general education environments and center based programming right we often see that for students who have an iep but we also know there are a lot of students who don't need the educational need for an iep but they still have some pretty significant needs and yes we can give students a five hundred four there are also a lot of families that would just like some support for their children with or without labels what can we do to better support kids within the school setting and so that's what debbie and i are starting to work on right now is so what does that look like what does it mean to staff it what does it mean to support it what is the structures that need to be in place look like what do we name them what does that consistency look like from one place to another and so that's what the conversation that we started last week was really just naming what i call the attributes of the school the attributes of the staff what are the systems and structures that we then create around that to make it look that way i know what the educational programming will look like for grove and i vetted that out and that's almost complete in our application at this point i'm just naming the finishing touches on special education components of that but in looking at that for if belswan was wanting to say hey in order to replicate this what are some key components that someone would need doesn't matter if they follow the same curriculum but having a workshop model really lends itself to that and so that's something i think they need to name if you're going to have an educational setting like this having something like responsive classroom for example is the overarching social and emotional learning support for the entire structure staff and students of the school so you've got to have a school that we'd be dedicated to treating staff in a way that they are role models for student behavior and student expectations so those are just a couple of things i don't want to get into too much detail but those were some of the things that we started to name as attributes does that help a little bit yeah it's helpful and it's also helpful just to understand that sounds like you're still early in the process too of figuring that out which makes sense and the other piece of this that debbie and i have chatted about is really the commitment to developing grove and really developing the model the shared model together and recognizing that yes belle has clearly has a sense of how this is implemented and what the approach is grove is going to hold a whole lot of expertise knowledge and understanding of what needs like what are the non negotiables it's kind of how we've talked about them in the past in terms of a k five setting and making those mesh because belle swan doesn't have that and so recognizing that as we were thinking through like well does grove just become a school of belle swan or do we develop this such that it's kind of a sister or school approach recognizing that there's going to grove is not going to be able to hold the expertise of a k five nor a public school and so that is really something that we're looking at how do we build that into an agreement such that we are working in tandem that it is a partnership still separate but it is a partnership that we are forging together and so that's a definite other piece that we're developing so with that there's the governance peace doctor farming got into a little bit of education plan work there are several components of the next application that will not be district contingent that doctor farman has already completed is working through things that were really overwhelming for us last time in terms of things like waivers and i told doctor farman when she sent me a completed initial draft of the waivers i'm like i remember getting that last time in like opening it and then closing it because it was just really really overwhelming for somebody who was new to charter schools and she's like no i think you know this is what we're gonna need and we can revisit it but you know this is this is the starting point it was like be still my heart so there are several components of the application that are already moving forward and i wanna pause doctor harmon is there anything else that you wanted to add just in terms of that progress or is it okay to move into district and facilities yeah i think that's okay i think the pieces we've covered are the good okay so we reached out in part because we wanted you to have an opportunity to meet doctor farman and also as may not be surprising to you our biggest challenge at this point in time is really facilities and as we've been looking at our options once we took a new building on the site of belle swan children center off the table the world opened up a little bit and because there were some assumptions that were made from the very beginning that's where the school would be maybe we'd have a temporary situation but it was always bdsd and once we took that off the table suddenly the world looks a little bigger and the real estate agent we were working with was really happy but we looked initially at we looked initially at some districts that touched broomfield right because we recognized that bellswan does have roots in the broomfield community and that might be a really important piece so there's adams twelve still boulder ballet school district there's jeff ko we talked a little bit about st brain but decided it might be a little bit of a far reach and more recently even though it's not technically a broom field district we just met with district fifty or i'm sorry not district it used to be district fifty i keep doing that because i used to work in adams county it's a westminster right so in the end i think what we're looking at is how can we identify or let's identify a radius of about a twenty minute drive from valswangeld's center recognizing that that's the center of our network and drop off schedules are everything right if you've got a kiddo who needs to be dropped off at belswan you're not gonna want to drive into boulder to drop off another child right so looking at it could be several of those districts but how do we create that radius and look at facilities that are within that sphere so looking at where we are now in terms of facilities we have one building in jefferson and jeco public schools that is a current charter environment i'm not sure if we've talked with you at all about this but looking at dural academy they have some space right now and trying to forge a partnership there where we might be able to use some of that space that would be wonderful and it's complicated given the status of the current school another thing that we've been looking at there's actually a church that is currently for sale in louisville so it's not a pinot where davidson mesa is not far off of highway thirty six this would be back in bbsd there's a church facility that's in land that are for sale we reached out to see if they would consider leasing they don't want to at this moment in time but we're kind of keeping that in the back of our minds that that is something that could definitely work otherwise i think what we're grappling with and where we've said you know we need some additional expertise obviously lynn's been down the construction road quite a bit but where we're looking for some additional expertise is really thinking about renovation it's an area that you know i think historically we've preferred to see if we could find other facilities where that would be necessary increasingly it seems as though that's an option that we need to consider as we look at the facilities that are available and what the options are and i think that's where we have a little bit of a knowledge gap in terms of the resources that are available and what the potential would be within our time frame of renovating an existing space and if there are for example certain spaces that are better lynn several times over has said churches are great for this and so we have reached out through faith based networks within the immediate area we haven't heard anything back at this point in time but keeping fingers crossed just looking for any expertise resources advice that you could offer in terms of facilities and some of these options that we've found yeah happy to talk through that we have worked on lot of leasehold tenant improvements renovations and again like for startup schools like that's the strategy that we also recommend to have like more leased options or like least two own options but before i jump into that curious on and again like this is like a three dimensional chess that each school who is looking to launch has to play is around facilities as the driver for where to launch or where do where can we get authorized and figure out a facility so i'm just curious like because again like the dynamics of each of the districts that you named are very different in terms of like ability to get authorized so just curious like how you're thinking about the trade off there in terms of westminster fifty versus adams fourteen verses adams fourteen i think is very difficult but otherwise like all the other jets so yeah fourteen would be a little bit far reached but it's a good question i think what we're increasingly hearing is that charter authorization is a bit of an undertaking regardless of where you go and in terms of the relative differences between districts it seems as though every time we ask about another district like with the league like tell us what you know what's going on here it's it's not it's never a real positive message and so i think honestly we're kind of in the in this sphere of one thing that we are considering and i'm reaching out to csi this week with bvsd released a csi was never even on the table so wanting to reach out to them revisit that potential in that conversation because that could tip us one way or another right if we really dive in to csi it seems like a great direction for us to go then it might be it might be worth consider you know considering one district over another at this point in time if we are looking at our preference really is to be an asset to a district to partner with a district and be an asset i'm not saying huge and tell me if you see something different but from what i've gotten across these districts there are relative advantages and disadvantages but they tend to kind of cancel each other out and what we are feeling fairly certain of is that grove is going to do well regardless of where we put it because in part because of our connection to belle swan being a known quantity our approach and having some fairly you know having a fair amount of reassurance that you know this model is something that's desired among families we anticipate it doing well in just about any setting as long as we stay close enough to valswan that said i am open to other thinking around this and again if we meet with csi and suddenly it seems like ok this is a direction we want to go then that changes matters go ahead lydia yeah i was just gonna say i'm just gonna close my door real quick but i am still listening ok i think the csi path makes a ton of sense to consider for the set of districts that are on your list when i think of adams twelve westminster boulder dress girl jeffco's lego yeah and jeffco's like maybe the one with of those the best chance but it still has a lot of turmoil going on right now and so i think the csi release is definitely gonna be the best path if you can figure out how that might work and i think terry will probably have a good sense of those districts is there one that may be willing to release you more than others i know in coming on what i heard from people and i think sudan sus might answer your question too is what i heard when i came on board is people felt such a strong values alliance with bdsd it was very clear that people had developed some relationships there but there was real values alignment and so that was hard obviously when the rejection of the first application happened and people were gearing up to want to do that again but then there wasn't a building of available the reason this shift to jeff cocaine is like heather said the jarrell building we think is an opportunity but it's such an awkward lynn and i met earlier today and we were talking about the logistics of that so darrell owns the building but they don't own the land that it's on but there's also some other things that i think from a building leadership point of view would be really also kind of sticky for us if it were to happen that we got authorized i think there would be some ongoing concerns about the building in general academica i think is the manager but also is the company that built that space for jerrell to be there and what ended up happening was i think a lot of the work that needed to be done in the community before that building was built maybe didn't happen and so it wasn't a desired location for a school as far as the housing community and folks who live there were probably concerned in the homeowners association so there's some stickiness there but then the other layer of that is whether or not that school is going to continue or not and if a partnership is really even feasible in their current state because they were k twelve then they went down to a k eight right now they feel like they do middle school better than elementary but they're not sure that their board is open and it sounds like they're missing more than half of their board members right now with their most recent president resigning last week and so we don't know there's just so much up in the air in the meantime we're trying to complete an application to submit it somewhere and so that's what's tricky too so it does feel like our facility is driving a lot of this just because we do need a place to be it would be nice if we were in the situation where we had a building in each of those places and then we could say oh well our values are most aligned here i did meet with someone for quite some time two folks actually from jeffco and it sounded like from the conversation that we had what they would want is a reassert assurance that we would be sensitive to their current situation of lowered enrollment and closing twenty one schools and the other piece that they would want to make sure that we were one hundred percent not a burden on the district in any capacity that we were fully sustainable financially and that we were nothing but a value add yes that's always the best case scenario and i still may need your technical support team to help me with my website or whatever so i can't say that we would never need any of the services that we would need but i also think they wanted to make sure especially in terms of special education that we were really closely aligned so that was the bulk of our conversation was talking about where we could be a value add in that space without us becoming a center based program which it sounds like they're not really looking for any way so in working closely with them i think if we were to pursue jeffco it would just be a constant stream of mutual communication going back and forth about that to make sure we were pretty tightly aligned in what would best support the district as well for kind of a mutual benefit and a reasonable but terrell was really the reason that we did consider jeffco because it's like you know particularly from a budget standpoint you know bbsd on the surface certainly looks you know like a better option that said there's just nothing there there's just nothing there in terms of facilities that we've been able now if we can renovate if we can get a wrap our brains around renovation a little bit and we could look at there are interesting facilities they just need a fair amount of work to become a school jeffco obviously from a budget standpoint not as appealing but on the other hand there's a building we're willing to consider it honestly i really kind of appreciated the conversation with westminster i'm kind of surprised that we didn't consider that previously it seems as though they may be more likely for a csi release or at least historically that's been their tendency with finding enrollment we have yet to talk to their liaison it was just somebody that i know who does administration at westminster public school so we still need to have a more in depth conversation adams twelve is still on the table both from csi perspective as well as ageists never know there might be buildings there so it's really difficult with the facilities challenge to rule out anybody at this at this point but we think we have a pretty good sense of what our criteria are in terms of csi local funding facilities the political climate like i said if you can give me a sense of don't go there on any of the districts we can definitely consider that it just doesn't it seems like it's a little bit of an uphill battle regardless of where we go i mean and rightfully so right i mean look at the federal situation alone is kind of is a lot so more than open though to your perspective on districts if there's somebody we should rule out or we should more heavily consider yeah i would just say when i said three dimensional chess so one part of it was facilities the part was authorization and the third big part is also enrollment so i think that is something that we also look at when we are thinking about like new schools to like what's the enrollment potential for that particular property because that is again the big driver for like long term sustainability so that just name that also and then i would say on the facility side the spaces that you have looked at or the church spaces or other tim or like spaces that require innovation like are these all up for sale or these are like are these like leads to purchase option or like some some kind of a structure where yeah there's a variety that are out there i don't at this moment in time even feel like i have enough of a sense of what's possible okay in order to really pursue or look at any of them some of them might be least to owe that might be an option for all i know in the church might even be an option that way that would put us back at bbse regardless yeah i just it would just be great to have a sense of like okay should you go down the renovation road there are resources there are not resources you'd have to fundraise you know just having a sense of yeah okay factors no that's helpful so i can then just talk about like what are the different types of not grounds up build but what kind of other facility solutions that we have supported charters with so like the first thing is to start with like understanding the affordability so looking at like in our school budget like on an annual basis we should be able to spend let's say ten percent of your revenue on facilities again typically charters spend around ten to twelve percent but again knowing like groves model that is a number to be tested because some of the schools that were serving high needs student population that i worked with in texas couldn't spend like twelve percent towards that so they were only able to spend like six seven percent at max so just making sure that we understand that number clearly because that then will give us like okay this is the maximum annually we can spend in terms of facilities rent or dead service so once we have that number clarity and we can just do it on the steady state like let's say three hundred student or two hundred fifty students school this is annually was what we are going to spend once we have that number we can basically then like that's a good starting point to start having conversations with folks or the properties that you are evaluating to say that so and then i'll talk about different structures so one is a simple structure where like you have a long term lease but that space requires renovation right so now if it's a commercial space like a strip mall or like a space that you're converting in that case like those are more commercial owners that own that space so for them like there is an incentive to upkeep that space and like maintain it so in those cases i've seen like seller has done or like the the landowner has done the financing for some of the improvements either one hundred percent or have done it in partnership with this school like school raises some money and then fifty percent comes from seller financing so that landowner financing for their renovation cost but making sure that and then they basically whatever loan that they are taking or money that source of capital that they have they basically build it in your lease total amount so negotiating a lease to like hey this is the maximum we can pay and then this is what it would yeah this is the maximum we can pay so whatever the actual lease amount is and all the new construction that would be like it should all add up to like that maximum amount is what you can negotiate with them so so seller financing plus long term lease is is what the common structure couple of schools in aurora and other places have done that both either with church or with or with commercial owners as well and is is that a a model that schools that have opened recently are using or is that something that is five plus years since you've seen that the landscape feels like it's changed so much that i just want to be sure that we're pursuing options that have been used recently yeah no i think these are the options that are that are still like eligible like so again like that's the starting point of your negotiation to ask landowner to finance to to make sure like because you're not owning the space you're leaning the space you're leasing the space so like it's basically like you wouldn't want to spend money in upgrading it and then ten years down the line if again like if it's it's minor innovations and like if it's not too much like and it the budget for lease plus renovation is within your affordability range then you can you can do all the financing yourself and like not but the only condition in that in in that is that it has to be a long term lease like for you to raise financing at least require like ten to fifteen years of lease term for you to be able to finance that because like lenders typically don't finance the term of financing is not beyond the lease term of the the space so negotiating the longer lease term is is what i've seen folks do and this is again a recent example from the springs where colorado springs where it's a it's a lease option but school is bringing the financing to renovate which school was this sometimes it's just helpful to like even go to their website no no it's a private school it's not a charter school it's an independent private school yeah that's doing that and because it's a church space they were like we don't have money to renovate this like we can give it a fifteen year lease but you will have to renovate it okay that's one so yeah we talked about like starting with lease and sell landowner financing lease plus like you bringing the financing but the condition is it has to be a long term lease the third one is typically like least two lease to purchase option again in first two cases also you can do like lease to purchase basically since it's a new school like it's hard to raise financing to buy the whole building but like least to purchase is is helpful because you're locking in the price today so once you get closer to your full enrollment that is the time where you basically buy it from them again two cases like if it's a commercial lender and they commercial owner and they have money they can they can do the upfront they can do the upfront construction renovation work and then build it in your purchase price at the back end but the thing is like you are basically in charge of like hey we don't want to spend more than this on renovation and this is the purchase price that we are fixing today based on your long term affordability number because one of the very recent cases i heard was like they didn't negotiate the price upfront and then in three years their board was like yeah we should probably buy the building and then seller was like asking for a very high price if that feels like this could be a long term home negotiating that that price up front is is what i've seen and then the second one is also like least to least to purchase option but like you are bringing the financing up front but you can do is like if let's say it's a one million or whatever is the number of like renovation that is required you finance it and then refinance it at the time of purchase so you you don't like let's say you're paying the lease for first five years and you have financed upfront the renovation cost and in five years you don't have to pay the whole renovation in five year term like you can amortize it over twenty five years but whatever is left for five years and the purchase price of that building you can refinance the whole thing at the back end like that's the most common model that i have seen is basically because it's very hard for a startup school to raise financing for the whole thing but like if you have the purchase option and you prove your enrollment and financial sustainability in the first four or five years then you should be able to raise like the full financing to buy the building and then refinance your renovation capital as well so those are the four types of like temp or permanent facility temp to permanent shift that i have seen the other option is also like again groups like blueprint like they do this again they they have their fees but again if it all works out for the you know like overall affordability i think that is another option to basically again as a startup school it will be difficult to raise financing but like if they finance like it's it's it's easier to get financing through them it is just that they will have some project management fee associated with it okay and then thank you for all of us and blueprint i think worked with debbie at like when she was evaluating the earlier site and they were like we don't know how this this is going to work so but like they have not been re engaged in like this new site search or this space so yeah yeah okay and in terms of i also reached out today to jane ellis and just thinking about so the work that she does versus blueprint can you give me a sense of like with offerings are there yeah so jane and ccfs they were doing so typically like when you go for this renovation financing also like a cdfi lender or a bank would only do up to a certain loan to value so banks typically do around sixty five to seventy percent cdfis go up to ninety percent loan to value but they still want ten percent to come from the school either as equity yeah mostly as equity in the project but with startup schools like they don't have that level of cash to put in as equity so what ccfs or blueprint ccf is used to do they won't they won't be doing it going forward so what they were doing was basically giving like that ten percent of sub debt which is junior to the main capital so that made banks and cdfis comfortable of like okay we can give the nine percent school doesn't have to put ten percent money upfront that sub debt is basically covering for it and at the time of purchasing the building in four or five years is when you basically refinance the whole capital stack so they bring that initial capital as a sub debt a low cost debt to basically help you raise the senior financing for this project okay so what ccfs was doing like blueprint provides that subnet to in the projects now okay okay thanks that's helpful lynn do you have any comments questions additional thinking around this just in terms of understanding where we are as grove and facilities that we've had in mind i don't think so you know i'm pretty familiar with what's out there in the market at this point in time options basically from a startup standpoint okay i guess my maybe my last question is just schools that you've seen be successful in opening in the last couple of years and what they're finding for facilities what they're doing with facilities anyone you've seen be particularly successful just getting a sense of right now the world almost feels it's not like we went from a world that was this big to this big and now i need to get somewhere around here and some of that will be with regard to the district right certainly if we decide that we prefer to be released to csi and just thinking through factors and the kind either the types of properties or just where people have been most where schools have been most successful recently the two most recent particularly in colorado yeah the two most recent examples that i think like both of those are church spaces or like one is one is actually like sharing space with another school and the other one is just a church space ok which again was a is a partnership with a church where church uses the space on sundays ok i wonder heather if it's worth connecting sidhunter should we connect tether with katie to talk about archdiocese options and just see if there are any in that area yeah i think i think that yeah that could be the other woman who's a broker with the archdiocese and they work from denver like all the way north and have hundreds of properties and she's worked with a lot of charter schools and so it's familiar with the lease to own and the scaling in that you could work on kind of charging you run a line to your enrollment as you're scaling up so i think they'd be worth just just seeing or we can ask her if they have any properties nearby and then connect to if so great absolutely katie what's your last name summer plumber with an h over okay that would be fantastic the other thing i was just going to say is you know the main thing we've learned about the last few years is that enrollment is tough in becoming more and more challenging and i know that you'll have some built in enrollment from the val community but the extent to which you can locate this school really is central to the parent base that you imagine is going to be supportive the better and i know you know that but i just it's enrollment is the thing that's going to make or break you these facilities conversations too and what we know is i mean once we lose the name recognition which we're just another school right and so we know that that is what that that if we can say fortunately brinkfield is such a strange little community with seven school districts and everything and we'd like to that's actually another downside to this space in louisville is that it's like right about twenty minutes from valswan but it's not close to any of the district boundaries which is honestly one of our our best business cases for any district right is that bellswan polls from you know seven different school districts seven to ten different school districts any given year and you know with all of the districts being concerned about declining enrollment that's something that we can actually bring right so going right into the middle of any district probably doesn't behoove us which makes room feels again you know a place that makes a lot of sense just in terms of our the business proposition that we are so regardless i hear that completely we'll be keeping that in mind anything else i appreciate the insight around we're going to continue to work the faith based networks fortunately i know somebody who's pretty well connected in those here in broomfield will continue to look at doral and feel out the opportunity there i was saying to doctor farman it just feels like right now they've got corporate staring at principals staring at board and nothing's moving so unfortunately that's a tough situation but if anything else comes to mind or comes up we're certainly all ears yeah and heather i'll check with katie and then make that connection on the thank you archdiocese speak appreciate that and all the progress is really exciting as doctor farman it's so good to meet you and just exciting there's a leader on board now for this project thank you well thank you all for your time today we really appreciate it we really do and all the information it's good to catch up to speed and thank you yeah take care y'all thank you have a good one bye bye",

me i'm so excited to hear the update i was like yay yes i'm expecting doctor farman for sure lynn may not be able to make it i believe she had to there's a family situation going on she's having to be with her grandkids and there here she is now she's coming anyway do you guys know lynn no okay i was on one of the calls with her before okay yeah okay fantastic hey lynn good afternoon everybody i wasn't talking how's everything going okay there's lots of few moving few more moving pieces but removing them so thanks cryptically glad you're and hopefully doctor fireman will be jumping in shortly in the meantime i suppose lynn it sounds as though you may not know sudachu and lydia after all is that true i don't think we met okay i wasn't their lunch at the league of charter schools conference last year okay it's good to put a voice to a name lynn thank you would you want to so lynn is our treasurer and lynn would you want to give a little bit of your background sure so i have been the executive director of operations in finance for stargate charter school for the last twenty two years so i've been with them from a four hundred fifty kid going into your first financed facility in two thousand three all the way up through this year to where they are now so lots of different experience both in day to day operations in school finance and also into starting and expanding enrollments we're now at one thousand six hundred kids k twelve and doing some additional bond construction at the school and going up with about two hundred fifty thousand square feet of k twelve space so pretty exciting stuff that's amazing and lynn are you still you're still there at stargate i'm not actually retired from that position two years ago i am now the controller for a send classical academies catalytic charter schools so i'm doing some controller work for chris scott at ascent and i've done transitional cfo work for stargate over the last couple years but really kind of tried to push them off on their own the end of fiscal twenty twenty five so i am overseeing their current construction projects because they do have this bond financing that we were lucky enough to bring in with adams twelve issue last year but that is the extent at this point in time ok great well it's good to meet you good to meet you too every time i hear lynn's background i just i kind of get a little exhausted but you clearly she's clearly the person to bring to a facilities conversation well yeah it's such great experience to have on the founding board for a new school yeah this really has been a great honor to help these help these guys move in that direction because i've done what now one two three five financing for stargate and four different major construction projects that's all awesome thank you lynn you bet hi doctor farman hello hi there sorry i'm having some technical difficulties my computer completely died i think the battery actually really fully died so i'm trying to get everything downloaded to my chromebook to be able to get on here thank you for your patience we were just going through some introductions so maybe we'll let you catch your breath and i'll move on to lydia and sudan shu since it sounds like everyone i'm the only one who knows everybody here so lydia or sudanshi would you mind introducing yourself yeah i can go and i'll be quick it's really good to meet you doctor farman and you just said hello to lynn as well my name is lydia hoffman i'm the founder and ceo of the colorado schools fund we launched this organization about a year and a half ago to really support new schools new public schools launching in colorado focused on historically underserved kids but both to provide grants and philanthropic support but also strategic support and to be sort of alongside founders and schools as they expand we have really three principles that we operate from at colorado schools fund the first is we're focused off historically underserved kids so looking at areas across the state where kids may not have access to great schools today the second is we have a really high bar for quality so we're a little crazy about for schools that exist already what their student outcomes and performance like and purdue schools their plan and the leadership to get to a really strong place for students and then the third thing is we're supporting schools that are opening in partnership with their local communities and really driven by family demand so not schools that are sort of just plopping down but ones that are really filling a need in a certain community and my background i spent twelve years an organization called the charter school growth fund which is a national foundation that supports the growth and expansion of high performing charter schools all over the country and i'm based in denver and have two boys of my own ages five and seven so we're at the early elementary years ourselves right now with kindergarten and second grade but it's great to meet you soon after you i'll turn it over to you yeah thanks lydia doctor fowman didn't nice to meet you i am sudanshu and started working with last year at colorado schools fund as we launched my role as lilia explained we support charter schools as they open as they launch and grow my role is also around like supporting the schools around finance facilities and all the other areas coordinating support from our extended team or consultants that we work with prior to that i was at charter school growth fund worked on the grants team and then also spent half of the time there on structured finance team where we were supporting schools on new schools on facilities and then also underwriting some of the creative loan structures to support early stage schools to get access to financing for their facilities and then prior to that i worked in india with a venture capital fund doing ed tech investments both in k twelve and workforce development space and taught in a public school for two years math and pretty much all subjects except their regional language so yeah had some spent some time in the classroom and lot of lot of great learnings from there i love hearing both of your backgrounds i think we've started with debbie and then i came in and we were kind of in the midst of the last application i don't know that i ever fully got your background so i'm so glad we took a moment for this yeah and doctor farman if you want to introduce yourself and just for context i can't i can't even completely verbalize what a game changer it has been to have doctor farm in the home board bringing all of her k five expertise and leadership and we're just so grateful she's here so go ahead doctor i feel like i can never really live up to the compliments but thank you well it's nice to meet both of you i'm doctor susan marie farman i am a first generation american a first generation high school and college graduate and i aged out of the farsis system and i share that because i have historically throughout my career worked with historically marginalized populations either through the special education process and then also with intersectionalities of identity so students who we know that students who are linguistically diverse or students who come from positionalities of poverty or different status of different phases of their status of seeking citizenship here so i've served in newcomer communities they tend to be over identified in special education populations as well and so i've done a lot of work and presentation on the oprah representation of linguistically diverse students students of color and students who are associates economically disadvantaged so it's always just been an important part of my service and my work i started out in center based programs for spirit and program students in seattle and when i moved here to colorado in two thousand seven i started working in denver public schools i've worked in innovation schools charter schools general public school settings but i've gravitated mostly toward places where there were intersectionalities of identities so i worked at place bridge academy for a few years where i could do translation work but also support work for people who are new to american education systems having navigated those myself it's always on my heart to support people to navigate those systems and then that wasn't enough i decided i needed a year supporting adjudicated youth to navigate post secondary systems which is a very interesting endeavor over this last year i was the executive director of a chartering jeffco for a couple of years helping them to kind of rebrand and recenter their school and i also am an adjunct for the university of colorado it teacher graduate course there for human resource management and staff development for them specifically they brought me on a couple of years ago they wanted someone with experience helping leaders to serve diverse populations of staff but also diverse populations of students and so it's been really just an honor to get to do that work and teach leaders how to lead people who may look and sound and be different than them culturally linguistically and economically religiously all of those things and this was especially exciting to me to think about serving the needs of students in a different way and being able to support in ways that we know students need but i don't know that typical public schools can always name right there's just a lot within typical educational settings that you can't address in a way that you can address when you're a charter and so i love the work of being able to shift the need and the budget and the support and the staffing model to fit what you actually need to do for your community so that's kind of just a little nutshell there i've been in colorado since two thousand seven and like i said we moved here from seattle but i've lived all over the country and we travel all over the world and have a deep appreciation for education in any setting great to me too thanks for sharing all that yeah so we can share a little bit and thanks everybody for the brief introductions just wanted to make sure everybody has a chance to get to know one another in addition we can share a little bit about the progress that we've made i went back and looked and i think it was early may was the last time that we had the opportunity to meet and it's just been significant progress in a variety of areas since that point in time i can start out talking a little bit about the governance piece if doctor farman you want to touch on some of the education plans and maybe even some of the messaging component speaking of messaging it was really fun yesterday we were back out in the community finally doing some outreach we revised our intent to enroll and we have our first few intent to enroll sign up so it's exciting to be starting again and it just feels really really good to be back out in the community and talking with folks and they're still super supportive and excited that road is still coming i can speak a little bit to the governance piece and that's something that we're partnering with debbie around so at this point in time we're looking at developing kind of an interim agreement with valswan children's center that recognizing what it means to be a bell swan school and that's something that doctor farman and debbie i think debbie is so grateful to have somebody she can speak apples to apples with now in terms of you know approaches what have you but across early childhood and k five but they put together they have put together some of the components that would be included in being a belong school which we've been asking for for a while and we're just really grateful that that's coming we know that there is interest and likely intention of developing a foundation of some sort that will provide support i'm really hopeful that it's going to focus for sure on research and data collection but then also some potential for fundraising support and that will be a little longer in coming but in the in the meantime we've recognized the importance of being able to say this is the relationship between val swan children's center and grove elementary school not only to make the public and private very clearly separate but also to demonstrate the alignment because we know that that's where the vision and the mission really originated and the approach in making sure that those components are clear so that should be finalized i would say within the next month or so and we'll have that agreement ready to and i know bell swan is also working with an attorney making sure that they're thinking clearly about what needs to go what kind of relationship that needs to be likely something that is more binding than an lu and we may also be providing a fee of some sort to bell swan children center for that support lynn un muted well i was just i was just curious just kind of in layman's terms like how based on where you landed what the what the relationship will look like or what bel swan will be providing or vice versa in terms of what they're providing that's really the next component and the piece that we need to finalize doctor farman i don't know if you'd want to speak to i can pull up with debbie sent me but i wasn't a part of that conversation in terms of the approach and what needs to be included in that approach is that something you'd be able to speak to yeah i think well she's still kind of trying to develop what that's gonna look like i think what she's figuring out is for val swan they know what they do at the ece level what they're trying to figure out because they're as debbie shared with me she's not an elementary school specialist and so for them understanding what it means to be a standards based school and following colorado academic standards and meeting those but within this idea of supporting students in these other ways and so what we've come up with is a framework of working alongside of castles competencies castle the organization for social and emotional learning and really comin ourselves to this foundational component of what it looks like to center that as opposed to it being this sort of peripheral add on so if that's the central tenet of what we're doing as a school then everything else kind of falling in line with that whether it's the curricular options that we've chosen in which case our el rea materials align not only with castle because their castle endorsed and they align with that but also it aligns with the workshop model which we believe is more conducive to students being able to meet their needs in a classroom being able to have small autonomy some space some opportunity for inquiry but also the evidence points to teachers being able to have a little bit more time for intervention time within that structure so everything we've done has sort of cascaded off of that piece in working with debbie i met with her last week to talk about what are the attributes then that we've identified you know that we wanna make sure that we're carefully picking who it is that we align with this work it can't be a teacher that doesn't have any training in special education for example we would want teachers who have some understanding of what it means to be dedicated to social and emotional learning that's still a fairly new area in education in terms of teacher prep programs for example incorporating that into what they do and so that was some of our conversation is what do we need to call out when we're looking for staff to staff a school like this we're looking for people who understand that this isn't a space where voice and choice come off the table if anything we wanna augment student voice and choice that's something that i often have to provide a lot of training for my staff around just in general so what does that look like in a school that's more of a mild moderate setting as a rule in my conversations with the special education director for jeffco one of the things we talked about is believing that there's a space between general education environments and center based programming right we often see that for students who have an iep but we also know there are a lot of students who don't need the educational need for an iep but they still have some pretty significant needs and yes we can give students a five hundred four there are also a lot of families that would just like some support for their children with or without labels what can we do to better support kids within the school setting and so that's what debbie and i are starting to work on right now is so what does that look like what does it mean to staff it what does it mean to support it what is the structures that need to be in place look like what do we name them what does that consistency look like from one place to another and so that's what the conversation that we started last week was really just naming what i call the attributes of the school the attributes of the staff what are the systems and structures that we then create around that to make it look that way i know what the educational programming will look like for grove and i vetted that out and that's almost complete in our application at this point i'm just naming the finishing touches on special education components of that but in looking at that for if belswan was wanting to say hey in order to replicate this what are some key components that someone would need doesn't matter if they follow the same curriculum but having a workshop model really lends itself to that and so that's something i think they need to name if you're going to have an educational setting like this having something like responsive classroom for example is the overarching social and emotional learning support for the entire structure staff and students of the school so you've got to have a school that we'd be dedicated to treating staff in a way that they are role models for student behavior and student expectations so those are just a couple of things i don't want to get into too much detail but those were some of the things that we started to name as attributes does that help a little bit yeah it's helpful and it's also helpful just to understand that sounds like you're still early in the process too of figuring that out which makes sense and the other piece of this that debbie and i have chatted about is really the commitment to developing grove and really developing the model the shared model together and recognizing that yes belle has clearly has a sense of how this is implemented and what the approach is grove is going to hold a whole lot of expertise knowledge and understanding of what needs like what are the non negotiables it's kind of how we've talked about them in the past in terms of a k five setting and making those mesh because belle swan doesn't have that and so recognizing that as we were thinking through like well does grove just become a school of belle swan or do we develop this such that it's kind of a sister or school approach recognizing that there's going to grove is not going to be able to hold the expertise of a k five nor a public school and so that is really something that we're looking at how do we build that into an agreement such that we are working in tandem that it is a partnership still separate but it is a partnership that we are forging together and so that's a definite other piece that we're developing so with that there's the governance peace doctor farming got into a little bit of education plan work there are several components of the next application that will not be district contingent that doctor farman has already completed is working through things that were really overwhelming for us last time in terms of things like waivers and i told doctor farman when she sent me a completed initial draft of the waivers i'm like i remember getting that last time in like opening it and then closing it because it was just really really overwhelming for somebody who was new to charter schools and she's like no i think you know this is what we're gonna need and we can revisit it but you know this is this is the starting point it was like be still my heart so there are several components of the application that are already moving forward and i wanna pause doctor harmon is there anything else that you wanted to add just in terms of that progress or is it okay to move into district and facilities yeah i think that's okay i think the pieces we've covered are the good okay so we reached out in part because we wanted you to have an opportunity to meet doctor farman and also as may not be surprising to you our biggest challenge at this point in time is really facilities and as we've been looking at our options once we took a new building on the site of belle swan children center off the table the world opened up a little bit and because there were some assumptions that were made from the very beginning that's where the school would be maybe we'd have a temporary situation but it was always bdsd and once we took that off the table suddenly the world looks a little bigger and the real estate agent we were working with was really happy but we looked initially at we looked initially at some districts that touched broomfield right because we recognized that bellswan does have roots in the broomfield community and that might be a really important piece so there's adams twelve still boulder ballet school district there's jeff ko we talked a little bit about st brain but decided it might be a little bit of a far reach and more recently even though it's not technically a broom field district we just met with district fifty or i'm sorry not district it used to be district fifty i keep doing that because i used to work in adams county it's a westminster right so in the end i think what we're looking at is how can we identify or let's identify a radius of about a twenty minute drive from valswangeld's center recognizing that that's the center of our network and drop off schedules are everything right if you've got a kiddo who needs to be dropped off at belswan you're not gonna want to drive into boulder to drop off another child right so looking at it could be several of those districts but how do we create that radius and look at facilities that are within that sphere so looking at where we are now in terms of facilities we have one building in jefferson and jeco public schools that is a current charter environment i'm not sure if we've talked with you at all about this but looking at dural academy they have some space right now and trying to forge a partnership there where we might be able to use some of that space that would be wonderful and it's complicated given the status of the current school another thing that we've been looking at there's actually a church that is currently for sale in louisville so it's not a pinot where davidson mesa is not far off of highway thirty six this would be back in bbsd there's a church facility that's in land that are for sale we reached out to see if they would consider leasing they don't want to at this moment in time but we're kind of keeping that in the back of our minds that that is something that could definitely work otherwise i think what we're grappling with and where we've said you know we need some additional expertise obviously lynn's been down the construction road quite a bit but where we're looking for some additional expertise is really thinking about renovation it's an area that you know i think historically we've preferred to see if we could find other facilities where that would be necessary increasingly it seems as though that's an option that we need to consider as we look at the facilities that are available and what the options are and i think that's where we have a little bit of a knowledge gap in terms of the resources that are available and what the potential would be within our time frame of renovating an existing space and if there are for example certain spaces that are better lynn several times over has said churches are great for this and so we have reached out through faith based networks within the immediate area we haven't heard anything back at this point in time but keeping fingers crossed just looking for any expertise resources advice that you could offer in terms of facilities and some of these options that we've found yeah happy to talk through that we have worked on lot of leasehold tenant improvements renovations and again like for startup schools like that's the strategy that we also recommend to have like more leased options or like least two own options but before i jump into that curious on and again like this is like a three dimensional chess that each school who is looking to launch has to play is around facilities as the driver for where to launch or where do where can we get authorized and figure out a facility so i'm just curious like because again like the dynamics of each of the districts that you named are very different in terms of like ability to get authorized so just curious like how you're thinking about the trade off there in terms of westminster fifty versus adams fourteen verses adams fourteen i think is very difficult but otherwise like all the other jets so yeah fourteen would be a little bit far reached but it's a good question i think what we're increasingly hearing is that charter authorization is a bit of an undertaking regardless of where you go and in terms of the relative differences between districts it seems as though every time we ask about another district like with the league like tell us what you know what's going on here it's it's not it's never a real positive message and so i think honestly we're kind of in the in this sphere of one thing that we are considering and i'm reaching out to csi this week with bvsd released a csi was never even on the table so wanting to reach out to them revisit that potential in that conversation because that could tip us one way or another right if we really dive in to csi it seems like a great direction for us to go then it might be it might be worth consider you know considering one district over another at this point in time if we are looking at our preference really is to be an asset to a district to partner with a district and be an asset i'm not saying huge and tell me if you see something different but from what i've gotten across these districts there are relative advantages and disadvantages but they tend to kind of cancel each other out and what we are feeling fairly certain of is that grove is going to do well regardless of where we put it because in part because of our connection to belle swan being a known quantity our approach and having some fairly you know having a fair amount of reassurance that you know this model is something that's desired among families we anticipate it doing well in just about any setting as long as we stay close enough to valswan that said i am open to other thinking around this and again if we meet with csi and suddenly it seems like ok this is a direction we want to go then that changes matters go ahead lydia yeah i was just gonna say i'm just gonna close my door real quick but i am still listening ok i think the csi path makes a ton of sense to consider for the set of districts that are on your list when i think of adams twelve westminster boulder dress girl jeffco's lego yeah and jeffco's like maybe the one with of those the best chance but it still has a lot of turmoil going on right now and so i think the csi release is definitely gonna be the best path if you can figure out how that might work and i think terry will probably have a good sense of those districts is there one that may be willing to release you more than others i know in coming on what i heard from people and i think sudan sus might answer your question too is what i heard when i came on board is people felt such a strong values alliance with bdsd it was very clear that people had developed some relationships there but there was real values alignment and so that was hard obviously when the rejection of the first application happened and people were gearing up to want to do that again but then there wasn't a building of available the reason this shift to jeff cocaine is like heather said the jarrell building we think is an opportunity but it's such an awkward lynn and i met earlier today and we were talking about the logistics of that so darrell owns the building but they don't own the land that it's on but there's also some other things that i think from a building leadership point of view would be really also kind of sticky for us if it were to happen that we got authorized i think there would be some ongoing concerns about the building in general academica i think is the manager but also is the company that built that space for jerrell to be there and what ended up happening was i think a lot of the work that needed to be done in the community before that building was built maybe didn't happen and so it wasn't a desired location for a school as far as the housing community and folks who live there were probably concerned in the homeowners association so there's some stickiness there but then the other layer of that is whether or not that school is going to continue or not and if a partnership is really even feasible in their current state because they were k twelve then they went down to a k eight right now they feel like they do middle school better than elementary but they're not sure that their board is open and it sounds like they're missing more than half of their board members right now with their most recent president resigning last week and so we don't know there's just so much up in the air in the meantime we're trying to complete an application to submit it somewhere and so that's what's tricky too so it does feel like our facility is driving a lot of this just because we do need a place to be it would be nice if we were in the situation where we had a building in each of those places and then we could say oh well our values are most aligned here i did meet with someone for quite some time two folks actually from jeffco and it sounded like from the conversation that we had what they would want is a reassert assurance that we would be sensitive to their current situation of lowered enrollment and closing twenty one schools and the other piece that they would want to make sure that we were one hundred percent not a burden on the district in any capacity that we were fully sustainable financially and that we were nothing but a value add yes that's always the best case scenario and i still may need your technical support team to help me with my website or whatever so i can't say that we would never need any of the services that we would need but i also think they wanted to make sure especially in terms of special education that we were really closely aligned so that was the bulk of our conversation was talking about where we could be a value add in that space without us becoming a center based program which it sounds like they're not really looking for any way so in working closely with them i think if we were to pursue jeffco it would just be a constant stream of mutual communication going back and forth about that to make sure we were pretty tightly aligned in what would best support the district as well for kind of a mutual benefit and a reasonable but terrell was really the reason that we did consider jeffco because it's like you know particularly from a budget standpoint you know bbsd on the surface certainly looks you know like a better option that said there's just nothing there there's just nothing there in terms of facilities that we've been able now if we can renovate if we can get a wrap our brains around renovation a little bit and we could look at there are interesting facilities they just need a fair amount of work to become a school jeffco obviously from a budget standpoint not as appealing but on the other hand there's a building we're willing to consider it honestly i really kind of appreciated the conversation with westminster i'm kind of surprised that we didn't consider that previously it seems as though they may be more likely for a csi release or at least historically that's been their tendency with finding enrollment we have yet to talk to their liaison it was just somebody that i know who does administration at westminster public school so we still need to have a more in depth conversation adams twelve is still on the table both from csi perspective as well as ageists never know there might be buildings there so it's really difficult with the facilities challenge to rule out anybody at this at this point but we think we have a pretty good sense of what our criteria are in terms of csi local funding facilities the political climate like i said if you can give me a sense of don't go there on any of the districts we can definitely consider that it just doesn't it seems like it's a little bit of an uphill battle regardless of where we go i mean and rightfully so right i mean look at the federal situation alone is kind of is a lot so more than open though to your perspective on districts if there's somebody we should rule out or we should more heavily consider yeah i would just say when i said three dimensional chess so one part of it was facilities the part was authorization and the third big part is also enrollment so i think that is something that we also look at when we are thinking about like new schools to like what's the enrollment potential for that particular property because that is again the big driver for like long term sustainability so that just name that also and then i would say on the facility side the spaces that you have looked at or the church spaces or other tim or like spaces that require innovation like are these all up for sale or these are like are these like leads to purchase option or like some some kind of a structure where yeah there's a variety that are out there i don't at this moment in time even feel like i have enough of a sense of what's possible okay in order to really pursue or look at any of them some of them might be least to owe that might be an option for all i know in the church might even be an option that way that would put us back at bbse regardless yeah i just it would just be great to have a sense of like okay should you go down the renovation road there are resources there are not resources you'd have to fundraise you know just having a sense of yeah okay factors no that's helpful so i can then just talk about like what are the different types of not grounds up build but what kind of other facility solutions that we have supported charters with so like the first thing is to start with like understanding the affordability so looking at like in our school budget like on an annual basis we should be able to spend let's say ten percent of your revenue on facilities again typically charters spend around ten to twelve percent but again knowing like groves model that is a number to be tested because some of the schools that were serving high needs student population that i worked with in texas couldn't spend like twelve percent towards that so they were only able to spend like six seven percent at max so just making sure that we understand that number clearly because that then will give us like okay this is the maximum annually we can spend in terms of facilities rent or dead service so once we have that number clarity and we can just do it on the steady state like let's say three hundred student or two hundred fifty students school this is annually was what we are going to spend once we have that number we can basically then like that's a good starting point to start having conversations with folks or the properties that you are evaluating to say that so and then i'll talk about different structures so one is a simple structure where like you have a long term lease but that space requires renovation right so now if it's a commercial space like a strip mall or like a space that you're converting in that case like those are more commercial owners that own that space so for them like there is an incentive to upkeep that space and like maintain it so in those cases i've seen like seller has done or like the the landowner has done the financing for some of the improvements either one hundred percent or have done it in partnership with this school like school raises some money and then fifty percent comes from seller financing so that landowner financing for their renovation cost but making sure that and then they basically whatever loan that they are taking or money that source of capital that they have they basically build it in your lease total amount so negotiating a lease to like hey this is the maximum we can pay and then this is what it would yeah this is the maximum we can pay so whatever the actual lease amount is and all the new construction that would be like it should all add up to like that maximum amount is what you can negotiate with them so so seller financing plus long term lease is is what the common structure couple of schools in aurora and other places have done that both either with church or with or with commercial owners as well and is is that a a model that schools that have opened recently are using or is that something that is five plus years since you've seen that the landscape feels like it's changed so much that i just want to be sure that we're pursuing options that have been used recently yeah no i think these are the options that are that are still like eligible like so again like that's the starting point of your negotiation to ask landowner to finance to to make sure like because you're not owning the space you're leaning the space you're leasing the space so like it's basically like you wouldn't want to spend money in upgrading it and then ten years down the line if again like if it's it's minor innovations and like if it's not too much like and it the budget for lease plus renovation is within your affordability range then you can you can do all the financing yourself and like not but the only condition in that in in that is that it has to be a long term lease like for you to raise financing at least require like ten to fifteen years of lease term for you to be able to finance that because like lenders typically don't finance the term of financing is not beyond the lease term of the the space so negotiating the longer lease term is is what i've seen folks do and this is again a recent example from the springs where colorado springs where it's a it's a lease option but school is bringing the financing to renovate which school was this sometimes it's just helpful to like even go to their website no no it's a private school it's not a charter school it's an independent private school yeah that's doing that and because it's a church space they were like we don't have money to renovate this like we can give it a fifteen year lease but you will have to renovate it okay that's one so yeah we talked about like starting with lease and sell landowner financing lease plus like you bringing the financing but the condition is it has to be a long term lease the third one is typically like least two lease to purchase option again in first two cases also you can do like lease to purchase basically since it's a new school like it's hard to raise financing to buy the whole building but like least to purchase is is helpful because you're locking in the price today so once you get closer to your full enrollment that is the time where you basically buy it from them again two cases like if it's a commercial lender and they commercial owner and they have money they can they can do the upfront they can do the upfront construction renovation work and then build it in your purchase price at the back end but the thing is like you are basically in charge of like hey we don't want to spend more than this on renovation and this is the purchase price that we are fixing today based on your long term affordability number because one of the very recent cases i heard was like they didn't negotiate the price upfront and then in three years their board was like yeah we should probably buy the building and then seller was like asking for a very high price if that feels like this could be a long term home negotiating that that price up front is is what i've seen and then the second one is also like least to least to purchase option but like you are bringing the financing up front but you can do is like if let's say it's a one million or whatever is the number of like renovation that is required you finance it and then refinance it at the time of purchase so you you don't like let's say you're paying the lease for first five years and you have financed upfront the renovation cost and in five years you don't have to pay the whole renovation in five year term like you can amortize it over twenty five years but whatever is left for five years and the purchase price of that building you can refinance the whole thing at the back end like that's the most common model that i have seen is basically because it's very hard for a startup school to raise financing for the whole thing but like if you have the purchase option and you prove your enrollment and financial sustainability in the first four or five years then you should be able to raise like the full financing to buy the building and then refinance your renovation capital as well so those are the four types of like temp or permanent facility temp to permanent shift that i have seen the other option is also like again groups like blueprint like they do this again they they have their fees but again if it all works out for the you know like overall affordability i think that is another option to basically again as a startup school it will be difficult to raise financing but like if they finance like it's it's it's easier to get financing through them it is just that they will have some project management fee associated with it okay and then thank you for all of us and blueprint i think worked with debbie at like when she was evaluating the earlier site and they were like we don't know how this this is going to work so but like they have not been re engaged in like this new site search or this space so yeah yeah okay and in terms of i also reached out today to jane ellis and just thinking about so the work that she does versus blueprint can you give me a sense of like with offerings are there yeah so jane and ccfs they were doing so typically like when you go for this renovation financing also like a cdfi lender or a bank would only do up to a certain loan to value so banks typically do around sixty five to seventy percent cdfis go up to ninety percent loan to value but they still want ten percent to come from the school either as equity yeah mostly as equity in the project but with startup schools like they don't have that level of cash to put in as equity so what ccfs or blueprint ccf is used to do they won't they won't be doing it going forward so what they were doing was basically giving like that ten percent of sub debt which is junior to the main capital so that made banks and cdfis comfortable of like okay we can give the nine percent school doesn't have to put ten percent money upfront that sub debt is basically covering for it and at the time of purchasing the building in four or five years is when you basically refinance the whole capital stack so they bring that initial capital as a sub debt a low cost debt to basically help you raise the senior financing for this project okay so what ccfs was doing like blueprint provides that subnet to in the projects now okay okay thanks that's helpful lynn do you have any comments questions additional thinking around this just in terms of understanding where we are as grove and facilities that we've had in mind i don't think so you know i'm pretty familiar with what's out there in the market at this point in time options basically from a startup standpoint okay i guess my maybe my last question is just schools that you've seen be successful in opening in the last couple of years and what they're finding for facilities what they're doing with facilities anyone you've seen be particularly successful just getting a sense of right now the world almost feels it's not like we went from a world that was this big to this big and now i need to get somewhere around here and some of that will be with regard to the district right certainly if we decide that we prefer to be released to csi and just thinking through factors and the kind either the types of properties or just where people have been most where schools have been most successful recently the two most recent particularly in colorado yeah the two most recent examples that i think like both of those are church spaces or like one is one is actually like sharing space with another school and the other one is just a church space ok which again was a is a partnership with a church where church uses the space on sundays ok i wonder heather if it's worth connecting sidhunter should we connect tether with katie to talk about archdiocese options and just see if there are any in that area yeah i think i think that yeah that could be the other woman who's a broker with the archdiocese and they work from denver like all the way north and have hundreds of properties and she's worked with a lot of charter schools and so it's familiar with the lease to own and the scaling in that you could work on kind of charging you run a line to your enrollment as you're scaling up so i think they'd be worth just just seeing or we can ask her if they have any properties nearby and then connect to if so great absolutely katie what's your last name summer plumber with an h over okay that would be fantastic the other thing i was just going to say is you know the main thing we've learned about the last few years is that enrollment is tough in becoming more and more challenging and i know that you'll have some built in enrollment from the val community but the extent to which you can locate this school really is central to the parent base that you imagine is going to be supportive the better and i know you know that but i just it's enrollment is the thing that's going to make or break you these facilities conversations too and what we know is i mean once we lose the name recognition which we're just another school right and so we know that that is what that that if we can say fortunately brinkfield is such a strange little community with seven school districts and everything and we'd like to that's actually another downside to this space in louisville is that it's like right about twenty minutes from valswan but it's not close to any of the district boundaries which is honestly one of our our best business cases for any district right is that bellswan polls from you know seven different school districts seven to ten different school districts any given year and you know with all of the districts being concerned about declining enrollment that's something that we can actually bring right so going right into the middle of any district probably doesn't behoove us which makes room feels again you know a place that makes a lot of sense just in terms of our the business proposition that we are so regardless i hear that completely we'll be keeping that in mind anything else i appreciate the insight around we're going to continue to work the faith based networks fortunately i know somebody who's pretty well connected in those here in broomfield will continue to look at doral and feel out the opportunity there i was saying to doctor farman it just feels like right now they've got corporate staring at principals staring at board and nothing's moving so unfortunately that's a tough situation but if anything else comes to mind or comes up we're certainly all ears yeah and heather i'll check with katie and then make that connection on the thank you archdiocese speak appreciate that and all the progress is really exciting as doctor farman it's so good to meet you and just exciting there's a leader on board now for this project thank you well thank you all for your time today we really appreciate it we really do and all the information it's good to catch up to speed and thank you yeah take care y'all thank you have a good one bye bye",

The discussion covered multiple charter school facility projects across Colorado, including updates on Hierarchies, Wildflower expansion plans, and potential new engagements with Compass Academy, Montrose Classical, Grove Elementary (Balswan spin-out), and DSST's K-12 expansion. Key focus areas included aligning on investment criteria, exploring financing options, and strategizing on how to support schools seeking affordable facility solutions outside the traditional district construction model.",

          "content": "Hierarchies Update: Project moving forward with Malt as GC contractor; total cost $650K with Laurel paying back $325K via lease agreement. Waiting on permits but confident of January occupancy to meet CSI agreement timeline. School showing strong academic performance during site visit.\n\nWildflower Network Structure & Financing: Wildflower operates as separate state entities (Wildflower Schools of Colorado has two charters). Financial analysis shows they can support up to $2.4M in financing for the Grand Junction church acquisition and renovation ($1.5M acquisition, $900K renovation). Church asking price is $3.4M but market value around $900K-$1.1M. Wildflower typically finances $150K-$180K for leasehold improvements through their foundation at 7-7.5% interest or previously through Jane (no longer doing construction loans).\n\nCompass Academy (DPS): Alternative middle school with declining enrollment (now 200 students) due to DPS taking away 2-3 classrooms annually from shared high school space. Single-digit proficiency rates present barrier for CSF grant funding and financing through CDFIs, though project management services may be possible. Looking for Southwest Denver location near transit for long-term lease using available funds for tenant improvements.\n\nMontrose Classical Academy: Charter recently approved by state with conditions after district appeal. Community-driven classical model with 216 letters of intent. Key concerns: no school leader hired yet (possibly Alyssa who led charter campaign), and enrollment policy unclear regarding serving diverse student populations in affluent area. CSF waiting on leader hire before proceeding with diligence or grant approval. School has $1.1M CSP funding approved and exploring church or office building options.\n\nGrove Elementary (Balswan spin-out): Restructured as independent charter with licensing agreement from Balswan (not full non-profit/public school intermingling). Looking at Westminster, Adams 12, and Jeffco districts for 250-300 student K-8 facility. Exploring temporary spaces requiring renovation while navigating district enrollment and facility availability constraints. Balswan leadership (Deb) reached out for facility support.\n\nDSST K-12 Expansion: Highest-performing 6-12 network in Colorado (16 Denver schools, 2 Aurora schools) exploring first K-12 campus in Aurora's Painted Prairie development with donated 13-acre site. Challenge: internal \"curse of prior expectations\" around $50-55M district-built facilities versus more affordable $20-25M charter-developed model. CEO Nella (from Yes Prep Texas) pushing for faster, more affordable approach while internal team (Nick) stuck in district construction mindset. This could be blueprint for 3+ elementary schools over 5 years. Qualifies for CSGF Dell Capitalist Fund if project budget is reasonable.\n\nZapier/Jane Financing Updates: Jane no longer doing construction loans, only $900K-$1M remaining for line of credit against CSP grants (not construction). This affects multiple schools' financing strategies.\n\nCSF Investment Criteria Alignment: Need consistency in pipeline evaluation. Academic performance is key barrier even for sourcing CDFI financing. Project management services can be offered when investment doesn't fit criteria, but schools must be along mission.",

          "content": "i heard karma talking about some cookies before i joined i don't know what they're talking about sorry we got a school fundraiser coming up my niece is baking cookies oh nice i'm not cooking about yes she's making about triple of what's needed so sorry about that i just heard how many she was planning and had to pretty much we don't need that many so sedans we're still on for next week yeah still on for next week i just got back from only because she's got some a family thing happening yeah and so i'm just going to add it so she can make it then it sounds like she may not be able to make it on wednesday for the lunch but just so she can come to either one yeah okay yeah do you know i mean she might be on on tuesday again like this family stuff like it's taking she doesn't know exactly at what time she needs to be out so that's why she's kind of keeping calendar open for now okay well i'll add her to our coffee if that works yeah and if she's out that whole week totally understand family first okay so lydia and i just got back from fair play hierarchies hi rob is it actually on my list yeah okay sounds good we can start we can go through the our pipeline but really i have three things that really wanted to cover today yeah one is it one is wildflower for sure kyrocky is just kind of an update on where that airs yeah and then i want to talk about csf's pipeline to ensure that we're consistent in our who are you know talking to yeah there were two schools that i had which recent conversations so we can we can talk through that okay so real quick update on hierarchies i've met with them laurel meeting with her separately because you know we're acting more in the tenant kind of a tenant rev role yeah malt is taking over so malt is going to have a contract with the gc they will pay the full six hundred fifty thousand and laurel they're they'll have by the end of this week their lease agreement which will show that laurel will be paying back three hundred twenty five thousand pursuant to whatever the terms are i haven't seen a little lease agreement yet i've seen the draft yet i should be getting that on friday ok yeah still waiting on permits on that one but malt is mil is working directly with the gc to get that they still talk to michael over at csi we're still confident that if we can get the permit in the next week or so that we will have them in but at first week of january which will be you know in alignment with the csi agreement which is they only have once this one semester to you know work out of the garage and the boys and girls club and the library so we feel like we'll have them yeah because it's all interior work so even though it's horrible snow up there it's all interior work so we should be ok ok ok that's great yeah we saw the school like again compared to all our visits like this was one of the strong starts they have like again like for first thirty minutes it took lydia and me like some adjustment to see the outdoor education model and get used to it but like when they were actually doing the projects doing math and reading like i think that was pretty good and then enrollment wise also like i think they are pretty on track so yeah no thanks for your support on the facilities or like at least the tenant we cite as they figure this out because yeah one thing we were discussing about like once it snows like what is your plan like because right now most of the time kids were outside like pretty much a whole time we were there kids were outside so it'll be interesting once the weather probably next two three weeks it will start yeah yeah i was in bail last weekend and there was already snail on the mountain yeah so it's coming yeah it'll hit hierarchies where it gets the rest of us are you going to want to see any documents is there any compliance documents anything that csf is interested in seeing no contract i'm good yeah yeah anything else on hierarchies no nothing else they'll probably start evaluating some of the pre k sites for the next year but she wants to get done with this first okay yeah the next one i wanted to talk about is wildflowers so i've tried quite a few calls and scarlett this is kind of for you as well i know you're listening but just perfect your ears up on this one so i've been dealing with you know you know kelly over there at wildflower and rachel i guess my question is they were telling me that is their understanding that they have two point four million dollars to either buy the church and do renovations so one point five for the church nine hundred thousand for renovations or if the church actually gets sold because there is another church that's actually looking at it right now they have that money that they can go and either buy something do a long term lease that sort of thing so i guess my question is and scarlett please jump in because you make sure i'm asking this correctly their understanding is they got the two point four million dollars information from you saying you would do a financial analysis so can you share that with us some support as well yeah i can share that so after i did the whole model for them both for their grand valley and aurora campuses so we used that as the base and then the only change to that model was that initially they had thought about different sites in grand valley similar to aurora but the change here is that they were thinking of doing the whole pre k eight here with like one hundred ten students so like that is the only change but i can i can share that analysis with you all ok so i've met with kelly for the grand junction at the church to expand that to pre k eight and now i'm meeting with alexi who is also going to come to grand junction and open a pre k one so i'm what i'm trying to do just full transparency is i'm going to put together some sort of contract so i don't know if it's going to be per school but the questions we had was you know how their schools work on separate operating budgets right yeah so the analysis that i did was only for this site which this church site yeah for ms site with with the assumption that they will go to one hundred ten students is where we what they had shared with me and savant to the two point four million that they can is that what they have that's cash available or that's total no that will have to be financed as well yeah that'll have to be financed so they can afford two point four million in indent yeah up to yeah up to that but that that is all in like including financing fees and everything like the total total project cost which includes like if if they like the acquisition cost and the renovation cost plus whatever the financing and everything that is required i see and okay so you can send over yeah i can i can share that analysis yeah which we which i did with emma and rachel were on the call so i pressure tested the assumptions with them around staffing and other things so i can i can share that with you okay and then do you know if they had equity to bring to a project they'll have to fundraise for that okay and what's the acquisition price on this church joy we put an l o i n for nine hundred thousand because that was actually market value but they're asking three point four okay yeah i know so waiting to hear back from the the broker called our broker and said hey you're crazy do you want to sharpen your pencil and our broker came back and said here are all the comps of all the churches commercial office everything that is sold in the last three years the highest is you know at whatever the square footage was which brings it to you know one point one i think was it and we went in at nine hundred and so we're waiting for that response back from reviewing all of our because he did he said well look if you go to the comps please send those to me that i missed so that was what we're waiting for the concert bring it to three point four million dollars so don't you all have you can you explain to me a little bit about this foundation structure so they had there's a foundation yeah no so so so there is a wildflower foundation which is a national organization now that foundation is basically similar to the kip foundation you you like that's the parallel so they don't run regions like regions are their own like how kip la or kip socal and others are there so wildflower schools of colorado is the entity that is operating schools here in other states where they so only in three states they are operating it as a charter in all other states it's more of a private school or or esa or other other options but only in three states dc minnesota and here are they they are operating as charters so so just for colorado like wildflower schools of colorado is the single entity that has both charters both aurora one and the grand junction one and that entity is that that entity has a single pnl like even though they have to report it like their internal philosophy is that they do a pnl by or budgeting by each center but it all rolls up into a single charter so so that is where like for that that was my question for them like which entity or like which unit should we underwrite is it like just this particular site or like your entire wildflower schools of colorado because that's the five hundred one c three who will be the borrower in in in this case so that is separate entity from the because you mentioned in other states they are yeah each state is a separate entity and then the foundation is basically another entity now the role of the foundation is basically the model providing professional development of teachers help in setting up a new region plus the wildflower has also received csp funding like for all charter schools for all all region charter schools so they have allocated certain csp to colorado charter schools so so they they basically are administering that and then the other role which also wildflower foundation plays is provide financing for upfront like construction which one of their sites in aurora took that financing but realized like their interest rate was even higher than what they were getting otherwise so so they're not borrowing on behalf of the school they're actually lending to the schools they are not borrow yeah foundation is not borrowing on behalf of the school that's lending to the to the to the regions yeah and i think i remember hearing their rate was around seven percent seven and a half yeah submit yeah wouldn't you model the two point four based on the two point four was based on a lower ppr but overall like blended rate of six and a half percent six and a half are you loading any money or any the funds that you've got so don't you go into the new ece one that the lady named lexi that i met with that she's putting in grand junction have you talked to kelly about that one so we basically have given a multi year grant to wildflower for their expansion so we basically like which which like full expansion to i think across both aurora and grand junction they have three hundred the charters approved for three hundred sixty or something students so we have given them full grants like but it's a multi year grant based on the milestones that they'll open these sites so once they have the leader or the teacher leader and the site identified we provide them the grant for the next site okay so we don't do loans it's it's only the grant that we have given them did i hear you say that so they have two charters one in aurora and one grand junction or they're operating under a single chart so there are two charters like two charters approved but but like it is more similar to like the lea is basically a single lea like in some states each charter is a separate lea like in california here like you can have overall lea and then multiple charters under that so that is how the structure is very flat schools of colorado is the lea that has two charters got it got it and this is a new school that has yet to start with students no they already have the grand junction school which it's in the same site that pre k through third during a church and they had the first right to expand to four through six okay this church has now filed it's not filed bankruptcy yet but they've got to sell the church because they're going under got it so they're offering that church site yeah that's blind site they're starting to get ready to open a second site they've got a new teacher leader she wants to do just the ecek one and then her kids would would go up to third grade but then they would funnel ended up four through sixth grade at the other grand junction site if that makes sense i just met with her on friday so so that's what i'm trying to yeah and then the aurora i have i've done three there and we have just one more we're doing expansion on one right now and then we'll do we'll add another in aurora but the most they can have with all of those is three hundred sixty eight something like that but then they're charters and so don't you just want to make sure we're aligned so it's given that csf is providing operating grants for growth this is i assume this is one that you would like us to consider for investment again if it fits your model like i mean hierarchies also we were providing but like want to make sure that it it fits your underwriting framework as well yeah yeah okay we'll have a look at it i'm just thinking like based on current size of how we size investments it wouldn't amount to much as we're only talking about you know less than three hundred thousand dollars be two hundred seventy five thousand for one hundred ten students but actually so sudansha if you could just send me the projections yeah i'll do that projections and the aquad yeah all right cool because i do think it's we're at the point now where they're asking enough questions that i think it's time for us to you know for crystal and i have a conversation i think once she's looked at the financials with the leadership of wildflower at least kelly their executive director i need to set up project man i need to start set up pmas with them knowing now what they want to do but also they're asking about financing okay okay anything else on wildflower where i move maybe not no it's just that like timeline wise joy like yeah still tbd right based on what church comes back with and if it is still within that okay yes so if the church comes back and they say we'll take the one million then we move forward and we'll literally have to jump on that because i want to close pretty quickly they have sold that three acres in the back to colorado housing resources so they're going to build on that three acres we got to do replading and that sort of thing but they're they're going to build some townhomes and things like ten or twelve townhomes got it and then scott just for context so for the other sites wildflower correct me if i'm wrong but other sites are mostly like this those are least space where wildflower has raised around like whatever they have financed around two hundred fifty k two hundred two hundred fifty k of financing to do the improvements some kind of improvements there so typically what i do is i have to keep my improvements anywhere between one hundred sixty and one hundred eighty yeah so depending on the size you know if it's the ece or you know if it's the one through three the fourth roof k because it build them out you know in chunks so i have to definitely keep it below two hundred but usually one hundred sixty to one hundred eighty is what i could keep it at and they've typically gone through jane yeah so they had we're going to go through jane with the last one meadow rue and there were some miscommunication things didn't happen so that's why they went with the foundation at seven percent or seven but maybe for seven and a half and maybe seven so yeah i i didn't see the loan disrupted their operating budget but so i don't know if meadow rue the second half that reach out to jane but so i said yeah so that's i'm trying to think i know they haven't reached out to for cactus bloom and i don't think they're going to reach out to jane for this other new one in she hasn't decided what flower she's going to be yet so let's see so yeah i know so all of wildflowers named after a flower every one of their schools so they're they could pick their flower so so yeah so she hasn't decided she's going to yes in the past scarlet like that is how they have like that's the size around one hundred eighty one hundred fifty to one hundred eighty k is what they have financed for leasehold improvements but this one this site would but like most of those sites have had like smaller enrollment overall this one is like more doing the whole pre k through six now and then pre k through eight once they get the charter approved amended sorry you fill the church up you know the sanctuary they've always got you know we already had to the drawings done with the you know with the you know based on the lace we were able to expand but now that they're selling it we're having to wait sit on it so they have a k eight model and they have an established ka model in aurora it sounds like and they operate that k eight on multiple sites yeah yeah so their model basically is that they do like an easy a lower elementary and upper elementary so that's their model because they want to keep it micro sites so in aurora they have like the one cluster which is pre k or like ece then ece as in like whatever early childhood to like kindergarten and then first to third and then three to five yeah that one and then and then they are doing like a another aurora replication for this but in grand junction because of the demographic and like how it is like they wanted to do it all at once side versus like three different sites for one tree one k through six which which is something that we have been telling them because from financial stability and then also from governance or one teacher leader to be the entrepreneur and accountable for academic outcomes that works better so we we feel like this at least one hundred ten is better than like thirty thirty thirty twenty kind of yeah okay so in aurora they're doing like a thirty thirty thirty yeah like again exactly yeah somewhere around that yeah yeah yeah yeah got it okay that's helpful thank you the model i'll send like it it has all the details of like how much is the capacity of each of the sites and those yeah okay okay let's see we're about halfway i was just gonna give you a heads up i've got a couple of new rules that i'm working on yeah i think we took this one last time we were together compass academy dps yeah looked at their numbers i think you know i've scheduled a call for crystal and i to meet with their executive director to go over her findings i think it may turn into just project management but i'll let you know yeah i know you had said that you guys have looked at yeah we we looked at compass we visited their site i think their academics are not there where we would be working with them so yeah yeah so and we're hoping to find out what the numbers are going to be you know break it south from last year i think we had last year's numbers but yeah so they they definitely have the money and they do want to find something that they can grow dps cut them down again three more classrooms so their enrollment has continued to leak on down because dps keeps taking more and more space away from them at that high school can i ask george i don't know if you know how how that allocation works but is is the loss of space a result of declining enrollment or is it that dps has taken the class from away and therefore they're losing enrollment yeah the latter yeah so dps has they're part of a high school so because they're a middle school and they got put in the bottom level of the high school so the high school continues to grow and so every year they take like two classrooms two classrooms and this year they took three so they had to actually tell some students they had to go to their home it's an alternative middle school they actually told some of the students they had to go back to their home home middle schools they and sorry just trying to reconcile how that there is no obligation from the district side to accommodate the current enrollment they can just produce the classrooms and they have to reduce their enrollment yes that's what i'm hearing from their executive director so good crystal and i are gonna kind of get to the bottom of it we have a meeting with him and the idea here they're trying to get off that campus i'm assuming yes yes stay in the same southwest area because they need to be close to the buses and the train station and that sort of thing obviously because that's where majority of their students are coming from so they've asked if i would help them try to find a location in that area and maybe do a long term lease because they were looking at purchasing i think what was it two or three million dollars they had him on hand or something so but i'm gonna let crystal have that conversation i'll be on the call and if we can help them financially great if not they definitely need project management so i'll just one quick second so yeah just aligned on what joy shared like their enrollment has come down and is now at two hundred students overall and then looking at their academic performance is why we kind of like this is their district so like it was single digit proficiency so that's why we we have not engaged with them so far yeah andre said there's an alternative school yeah middle school yeah and it took demographic to serve yeah and chris will take early on already because of academic performance is that we would be unlikely to invest in this or we could do project management yeah i think though i'd like for her to hear the story you know and we could definitely source financing we just may not be able to give financing ourselves right so i've heard brandon to feel like he's heard because he was the one that was bounced around on to everybody and he finally found me and he was like finally somebody that can like tell me what i need to do and so what i want to do is have him feel like he's been heard and then if we can't help him financially that's fine but maybe we can source financing we definitely could do project management but i do think it's along our definitely along our mission of helping the students yeah yeah enjoy when you connect with crypto i'm sure she'll go over but sooner that's sagashi notice that the academics will be a barrier even for sourcing financing from a number of our partners and cdfi the chief financing like they're all going to have pause at that and so just to be aware that even that will be it's not easy thing to secure so what i'm hoping is and i've been looking with a real estate agent i'm hoping there are some buildings in that area that are a little run down but i'm hoping if maybe we can do a long term lease we can use some of those funds to do tenant improvements to be able to use it as a school so i'm hoping and then at that point they wouldn't have to source any financing right so i don't know i'm just i just i'm just trying to find a way to help them out and even if we're no but even if we're just working with him taking through the process so that he gets smart on kind of how all that works and can can know how to better position school even in the future i think it's it's worthwhile that's part that's part of the mission as well so yes certainly worth the time and then the other one real quick because i want to get to years montrose classical so that you know i've been in touch with them really since you guys put me in touch with them they came back that the board i think you know the state board of education senate backed the mantra okay so they that they voted to approve their charter with conditions i don't know if you talked to don or not so you're shaking your head so maybe you already know all this so don and i've been in conversation and so i am going to be scheduling a meeting with donna and hopefully crystal i've got to get some dates back at times to meet so they want to hire us for our services and i don't know if it's going to be they reach out to jane and this is another i've got i'm having coffee with jane next week because i just don't understand based on all the conversations we've had they were they were told by jane that they're not loaning out money anymore but yet i thought on that call we had the jane they were learning money just short term yeah but like this is also very small size loans it won't be for construction like they only have one million dollars left from daniel's fund so so they are only doing those line of credit against csp kind of like two years right yeah that was the line of credit not the construction loan so they are not doing any any more construction yeah okay they don't have like they i think they only have left nine hundred k or or a million up to a million that was a grant from daniels not the pri okay they got one point one as a csp approved montrose did again according to donna so i put her in touch with and thanks for the when i was it you or was it peter somebody introduced me to marco so i went and had breakfast with margot last week she's a senior vice president alpine you know who's handling all of those the daniel fund so i'll put them in touch with her as well she said that she spoke to the league yesterday she has indana and that the lady said everything's on hold because of the shutdown so she was going to reach out and talk to margo no funds are being moved given reimbursed nothing so but anyway so that's another one that i don't know if we'll do financing i do want to hear her story and then talk to them a little bit more they've got a church and an office building that they're looking at right now obviously the office building would need more ti than the church so yeah so i can i can give you a little bit more context on the school and like our conversations with them so far so montrose classical i think like this has been like a more of a community initiative like their families have come together and they want the classical model in montrose again it has been a long fight for them to get denied by district go to state appeal and then get approved there so they have done like a lot of work with them like for us like the biggest question for them was the student population that they're going to serve while there is an intent to serve high like more diverse student population their enrollment policy or like some of the things that we have discussed with them it's not clear of like how they are going to do that again knowing the location knowing how they are going about it like this might be the option where like more affluent families sign up for the school and like it resonates with them especially because it's also a classical model and like so far the effort has been from the families that are more affluent while so so that is where we are we have left with them and the second thing is that they have not identified the school leader yet like who's going to be the academic vision holder or school person who will run the school so two things where we are like working with them on one is who's the school leader because the student demographics that they serve in the long term like will also be tied to like what's the vision of that leader and how much effort they are putting to make this school more diverse and then the second thing is like yeah just figuring out how this yeah how the enrollment for their founding year because they're still looking to launch next year so how how that holds up so right now we haven't finalized if we are doing a grant or a full diligence with them unless they have like without leader like we have never done a diligence or approved a grant so so that would be that would be like i think the main holding point for us till they identify the leader and then the demographics yeah so donna who's the president of school board yeah she said that she wants to meet either thursday or friday they said they have two hundred sixteen letters of intent for her families yeah and i would be meeting with her in the new principal so i shouldn't say it the leader was a principal is it alyssa is it alisa or somebody or is that another leader no there's another person who's working on who worked with them to get through the charter and everything at least like last week from what i heard from lydia's conversations from last friday i don't think they have hired like a school principal maybe somebody else on the board yeah alyssa is the person who we have been engaging with as she ran the whole campaign got parents together and did the state board of what's her name alyssa yes yes yeah okay so if you're meeting her like again she's great and if she becomes the school leader that would even be better because she's she's most aligned on in terms of student demographics she would like the school to serve okay but i like at least till last week she had not finalized if she will be the school leader okay now do you have any documentation because i did tell her that if we were going to meet with crystal that i was going to need to see financials she said she had every bit of that like five year financials five year enrollment analysis she said she had anything i needed she said she could send to me do you no i i don't have no it's probably the work that they did for their charter application so might be worth looking at it yeah good sorry joy so on friday i thought they didn't have the charger so in the last couple of days they did get a charter approved yeah there is verbally approved at the twenty third board meeting and it's approved with conditions like a traffic study so that's why donna called me she was like i need you to help me and she said you know if i need to hire you how does that work with blueprint so scarlett charter is approved the leader is not hired right the leader's not hired okay yeah we were talking on friday the charter was not approved either okay also the charter is basically they sent it back to the district to approve like state said that yeah this should be approved the sent it back to the district district is basically just playing ball in finalizing the contract so those bunch of conditions yeah because they don't want a charter school yeah so they've added they're making it difficult yeah to make it difficult classical's first school right this is a brand new school yeah all right so whatever i find out on that donkey or whatever information i get from donna or elise or alyssa whatever the name is i'll just share it with you yeah and then yeah once we have more conversations around the school leader and others i'll keep you posted based on what we discussed okay okay okay that's what i had what do you have for me so the one that i have this was the conversation i had yesterday grove elementary which is bal swan has surfaced she reached out to me yeah so that has surfaced again and i told her yesterday of like so i think that the new update or a good update is basically like they are not planning this project like with the whole bal swan umbrella like this is a this is a separate charter because when they got denied last year one of the feedback from boulder valley district was that hey there is this non profit and there is this public school funding this public non public intermingling of funds they were not clear about the governance structure so what they basically have done is have like a more independent charter with a licensing agreement with balswan so there will be more like the model sharing the professional development but like no significant and then their foundation might also help them with the fundraising stuff but not like an official part of the same five hundred one c three entity that they were initially envisioning so this charter will be filed separately now now they basically are figuring out this three dimensional chess of the district to apply for this charter where the facilities available and where there is growing enrollment again enrollment is not as big of a challenge for them because of the student population they are targeting i think for them the more thing they basically are trying to figure out the facility option so they they they now are not tied to like just bvsd they are looking at westminster which is only like eight minute drive from there less than my they are looking at adams twelve and they are also looking at jeffco they have looked at some of the some of the facilities through the broker again they haven't they don't have an exclusive contract but they were looking at certain properties and they said that like all these all these church or like these temporary spaces are requiring some kind of renovation so they were trying to understand of like even if it's a temporary or a long term lease like what are the options do they do they have if they are not going with the grounds up build like what kind of temporary facilities that they can get into so what i shared with them they're looking forward like a thirty fifty thousand i mean like a normal kindergarten i mean an elementary school yeah like a normal elementary school and i think their their charter would be around two hundred fifty to three hundred students is what three hundred yeah maximum of up to three hundred students but again like yeah so so now like at least based on this new like this charter school board that they have the discussions that they have had they are more aligned on like yeah it has to be an independent space not part of this whole twenty thirty million dollar project we know like we have to be in like a affordable facility they also are have gotten a round of like grounds up build is not possible but now what are the options that they have is something that they need help trying to figure out and then also like she reached out to me on my old company email oh okay probably responded to her from blueprint she was like oh let me get some more information i'll check back in with you and i haven't heard back from her so yeah yeah yeah so i think like i think initially like it it would be again they don't have the charter approved yet but like for the charter they need to show like these are the two three options or this is the strategy that they'll go after and then depending on the facility they would like to have they would like to figure out which which district to apply to okay do you want me to reach back out to her do you want to i know there's not an e introduction needed but do you want to somehow connect us again yeah because i had the conversation yesterday i'll just like send like yeah a reintroduction there because you know westminster i got a call from you know we're we're buying the aak building from cec right so mark who's executive director over at cec for the facilities they're getting ready to sell that high school in westminster oh okay yeah they're getting rid of it so that might be an option for them but i think it's probably it's going to be probably way too big for an elementary school it's a it's a high school right now but but it's owned by cec yeah oh okay yes they're high school up there so i was supposed to go tour it probably sometime i want to go tour before i had to drive up to boulder i mean to westminster in the snow okay and then the last one is more of a brainstorming so i'll need more brain power here is figuring out dsst so yeah i met with them you met with nick okay yeah nick and jacob i went to a women's thing whatever over a glass of wine nella was like i need to hire you and i was like oh okay so i don't know if there's the line talking or she actually liked what i was telling her about you know what brent does but anyway the next day i get an email from nick and jacob and i went and spent about an hour with them just chit chatting about blueprint what blueprint does i didn't do like a full formal whatever because that was not like a i think it was more of a nail it wants us to meet you so we're going to meet you but then once i got in there they were like oh and realized you know that i knew what i was talking about jacob and i talked a lot about facilities cost of facilities i sent them a couple of things via email and just to hear back from them but they did also go meet with the developer and i don't know how that meeting went for some land out there in aurora out close to not at the airport but out that way painted prairie i think painting yeah painted something denver school of science and technology so they are the biggest network here in colorado so let me give you like a little more context and like where i need i would love to work yeah because that is that i guess is door to more like working with the network so dsst they have i think sixteen schools here in denver and two schools in aurora right now it's the highest performing sixth through twelve in the entire state i think twelve of their sixteen schools were like blue ribbon or like what whatever the count is so very high performing school grew very grew very pretty quickly in seventeen eighteen twenty seventeen eighteen time when denver was like more progressive and like wanted to have this portfolio approach so they basically have six through twelve schools so they run like middle school and then they started as a high school but now have like a six through twelve pipeline very strong financial position primarily because all their schools in denver were all district facilities and those district facilities were also like pretty big like soccer field and football field and others so and then they went to aurora in twenty twenty two so aurora basically had a partnership with them where they included them in the bond and then dsst and aurora's public schools foundation did a joint fundraising to have another thousand student six through twelve campus so that is the ast one project so lot of philanthropic organizations foundations here came together made that happen but and then they've got approved by aurora for two schools so this was one six through twelve and then another six through twelve campus but the second six route twelve campus it delay it has delayed twice already and now finally opening in twenty twenty eight because the board changed the superintendent changed everybody changed so now like and then even dsst there was a leadership change nella came from yes prep and she took over so the second school now finally got approved they have included them in their cop and like our aps board has also approved so they will be locating with another high school that is coming up for aps so they are going with the second school also but the total project budget for this school excluding all the shared space that they will have all the soccer field and everything is fifty five million dollars forty five fifty to fifty five million dollars so fifty eight yeah so fifty fifty eight probably yeah crazy yeah so the deal is basically they are going for cop with aurora which will raise around forty forty five million dollars and they are jointly raising twelve million dollars to make this work as a fundraising piece again this is a separate project not through this the reason i was giving this context is that here we are dealing with the curse of prior expectations which is we are used to these forty fifty sixty million dollar buildings what do we do now now and that is where nick has been with the organization for so long i think he is still in that mental block of like how does it work on a lower budget or like how do we do this yeah how do we make it work kind of like if and then so but nela who is the new ceo she comes from yesterday from texas context she wants to run quickly like how texas is used to and yes prep has grown over time she has her expectations that she is like building is not my program i am very flexible it is just the internal team and change management that she has to manage so now this painted query like this is the third aurora campus that has come up the developer really wants them there and dsst also wants to expand to full k through twelve instead of just six through twelve so this would be their first k through twelve campus they have never designed an elementary school before like all their schools both either district buildings or these new constructions have been through yeah have been basically like grounds of construction so they are open to do that but like they need to figure out like what is the path to that how much it is going to cost we are ready to adjust our design elementaries the new area for us we will ready to do that but right now they don't know how to do that and then nick also has this block of like how can it be done without spending fifty five million dollars lidan and i were brainstorming is one we have examples from idaho where folks are doing rounds of build gem prep has done k through twelve pre k through twelve and their buildings are costing somewhere around twenty to twenty two million dollars and then with developer partnership developer is basically donating the land and all the site improvements so around four to five million dollars three to four million dollars are getting reduced there so school is only financing seventeen eighteen million dollars total currently so which works out for them around fifteen percent of the ppr so those were one examples that i am planning to share with them but i am pretty sure you all might have like many more examples from california texas others were like even if it s a grounds up build and you want to have certain standards fifty five million dollars price tag is something i'm finding it difficult to wrap my head around so i think part of it is urgency around like this developer conversation has opened up now and they want to figure out how to have a k eight or k through twelve there but it has to be more aurora doesn t have capacity unless they go for a new bond next to do this so they are trying to figure out like if dsst has to do it on its own how would that work and then what is the design what is the budget that they can get to so they always start with the building and this fifty five million dollars we have to figure out for them or with them is that what is the realistic number that they can still get to without taking out all the bells and whistles soccer field so this was for expansion to a third campus near aurora yeah it is a new development yeah private site or would it be the districts of inviting land for it most probably the developer will providing the land for you thirteen acres and the developer they are building so many homes they would donate the land donate the land yeah with lisa at a very low for dsst before so they have done with oakwood homes with awkward homes in green valley ranch they have done this model before where developer because they are such high performing schools developer has an incentive to bring them in so that they can sell more homes right but certainly it is land is near free we'll say yeah the land acquisition does not need to be accounted for as part of the budget right now the other thing we talked about sadanche we talked about the one with the painted prairie developer out there but we also talked about a possible k five or k eight for about one thousand two hundred students with that with this k twelve yeah i think it s that the same it s the same one they wouldn t build just in elementary they just do the whole k twelve ideally yes yeah ideally ok yeah because he talked to me about if they look at a k pop or a k eight if we talk about different land we talked about lotus for one thousand two hundred students around seventy thousand square feet but i talked to them the morning and that afternoon is when they all met with painted prairie so you've probably talked to them since they had the meeting with painted yeah yeah i think that conversation they were like yeah this conversation has opened up again like how do we figure out if dsst has to go by its own without any district bond support is that right no that was going to be for the k eight what sfk twelve total i don't know what the k what would the k twelve bed so they typically have around five hundred students in six through eight and then around another five hundred in nine through twelve and then k through five i think they are counting seven hundred so if they re only doing k through eight then it will be one thousand two hundred and if it s k sorry k through eight it will be one two hundred and if it s k through twelve like yeah around seventeen ok and then joy you said that seventy thousand was for the possibly k pop or a k eight because twelve n yeah but a lot of that was just well we're meeting with the developer this afternoon we ll get back with you so it sounds like they did meet with the developer and decided on k twelve it might be k eight joy i think this is just again design phase or iteration phase so they might only think of k eight right now and do nine through twelve later maybe second third phase thirteen acres out there if they needed to and the developer is just providing the land or is the intention that the developer also has a team that s going to be doing the design construction all of that is it a package deal or are they free to develop however and with whoever they want on the land or is it my understanding is like that is to be negotiated if there s incentive and cost benefit for developer to do that we can propose that that is something that we can propose as a design of what we want and siranche you mentioned so there s this prayer there s this potential for this donated land from a developer and denver wants them to expand to throw to k twelve no so denver denver doesn t want them to grow nella wants to expand but in dps like getting a new charter approved is close to impossible so that s why and our advice to them was also like hey you are going into elementary for the first time don t do it as a turnaround because that s two x three x more harder than starting afresh so that s why they are prioritizing this k eight first get the model right for elementary school and then approach dps of like you have tens of low performing schools i think she ll give you a proof they bring enough money into dps yeah they can but i think for her it s getting the model right before they do that we did talk about that yeah and then she does want to go look at k eight s and things like that so with these sixteen schools i mean so yeah i'm just curious if they have been primarily operating on district land it sounds like they are having some bond issuances so they have borrowed money from the bottom so most of these schools are district facilities some of these are by them but like district has put in bond money or basically have bought and then leased it back to dsst so those are the things aurora like so the thing with this third school is aurora doesn t have capacity in their current bond to go after this school developer is basically like if i wait for aurora to pass the bond and like build this it will take them another five seven years they want to sell start selling the homes as soon as possible so they want to partner with dssd so they have an incentive to bring dssd in and that s why they are donating the land sst in your portfolio now they haven t opened a new school in last three years but we already pretty much have done the diligence for this second aurora school it s just that the facilities got finalized very recently and it will open in twenty twenty eight so we are not like it three years out right now so next spring is when we will basically provide them the grant for that school but if this third school happens sooner than that we pretty much are ready with our diligence to approve and then they are also part of csgf portfolio right ok and this school is not part of the growth plan so they will be fresh grant funding from charter school growth fund also once if this gets rolling ok so you are not sure if they have the right status in the csgf portfolio to qualify for the dell capitalist fund no they can qualify but they can qualify but then also not going with a fifty five million dollar quid it should be affordable so that criteria for the csgf yeah that's good to know in terms of sourcing financing for like a twenty million dollars project yeah no definitely i think they will looking at their financial health the fundraising that they'll bring into this and then the rest of it through financing i think we'll have to put the capital stack but right now i think the biggest thing that they have to figure out is that how to get it done in more reasonable like what should be the design how should we get it done incidentally there's you know there's a couple ways to approach that i think one of the ones we'll be going starting from affordability so what does it look like given their anticipated enrollment and all of that projections how much could they support when they don't have denver support and then that could drive ok well what type of budget are we talking about and that's not sufficient ok what type of fundraising are you looking at doing in addition to your school budgets yeah so i think that part is fine but i think where they are stuck is actually getting like ok they come up with a number let's say they can afford twenty five thirty million dollars let's say but their experience is like oh this can only be built for fifty million dollars and that's why they are stuck like i think what we need to or what we need to work with them on is that if they can afford thirty million how to get the design and build yeah how can we what design works for that and like how does that align with their model is where we need to work with them so we already have the target number then so target number i think we can quickly pull because they did that for their aurora campus anyway so we can we can get that number quickly and then we can also have like a plug for the fundraising stuff which again not worried about dsst and fundraising they have done twelve million for every building so very well respected yeah cml yeah so when i talk to eric and jacob they wanted me to set up some schools for them to go tour is that what you're hearing as well yeah that was again like lydia's suggestion to neila is that because neila is convinced she has worked at yes perhaps she knows how to get this done and this can happen yes prep has done that it's like the old guard the team that she needs to convince that this can be done so that's why she's like they were very surprised lotus for they were like is that just like paint on the walls and i'm like exactly right so that is the mindset that they are coming with so lydia basically told nella is like ask them to visit few schools and look at the design and like see that because they have not seen projects being done in thirty million dollars so yeah okay do you want me to follow back up with eric or is that a conversation look me in on think i think what would be helpful is you and i have a conversation with sit with nick share the examples of like what we have and then also like because right even sharing the examples won't convince because he'll be like oh those buildings are not per standards of dsst so we'll have to like figure out like what schools because that's why i was thinking of like going to idaho with nick but because of some of the traveling schedule it's not working out in the near term i do want to have a conversation with you about idaho too so at some point not today obviously maybe yeah because some i also need to figure out how did they get the two percent financing done in idaho recently i'm guessing it's usda but i don't know you know that's how atlas they got usda financing yeah yeah so yeah i think next steps on that joy let's you and i meet with nick my guess is that like this will require us to like work with the design firm or design architect firm to kind of create a plan with them and do the costing or make it with him whatever is the number for twelve hundred students it works out okay so are you thinking like i have some examples you know i've obviously have k twelve k eight that i've built from the ground up here in colorado i mean over the years would that be beneficial are these district if these are district buildings then i'm i don't know what their budget was and more recent i think like more like more charter examples which were done within okay that i think are the are the ones we need to but again like those examples would just be the starter like k eight shorter i haven't done a k twelve chart it'll be k twelve that i did was when i was douglas county school district we bought we built three of those and then the part two of that is more critical joy like is is there a design firm that we can work with to create initial designs and do the cost estimate without land if we have to do the cost estimate what what is that okay yeah i've got a couple of that i actually built the buildings at douglas county that i was really impressed with their their work so and i've used them since with charter schools so yeah so i guess like let's do that like let's let's meet with nick propose this strategy of like working with the design firm to get to the get to like what would it cost because another piece of it is also like when when they are going through the district and district is building all these fillings like they have to follow the prevailing wage and other things like that also increases the cost with twenty twenty five percent at least so that is also like another thing where we'll cut down the cost like if we go around that so we'll have to figure out like how to what's the cost of gate if we have to do it yeah i had asked them to send me the design they said it was a book the design book for dps for building schools yeah but yeah that's what we are that's what we have to push them on is like we are not going by dps design standards yeah that's what they were saying why it costs so much is because they had to follow the book of standards yeah because it was district building yes but now we have to get out yeah like if we come out of that and if we do it more grounds up and get rid of prevailing wage and like some of these design requirements like what would it cost so it's really just about helping them understand like private facilities can be done and they are often they are most often done with like half of what you've been doing with district facilities and here's what a twenty million dollars building could look like yeah because it may also be some expectation setting as well yes yes i think that change management soccer fields and gymnasium and stuff like that that may not be possible without submit for fundraisers but how do you build a project that accounts for that stuff that might happen later on right let's enter your building let's get you your core stuff and if you need a few years to fundraise to come back and add a gym to come back and add a field like how do we how do we plan an account for that in the conversations with the developer yeah like lotus is a good example i mean we're not going to be done with that for several months but right like school owned a site they have some play fields doing some new construction and so you can speak to sort of base development and different play in front of they go colorado examples i mean you can go to the blueprint website and look through like all of our projects see pictures of the types of schools that we've built number of classrooms square footage and get that book so started why i said like it was curse of prior expectation was also like what families were looking for is that if they open a new school five miles from their existing schools families would be like hey this building is very different like you don't offer soccer or whatever program here like why should i say but like now the window has opened up because they are doing elementary for the first time yeah so like for them also like how they position and market might change so this is a good option and while i'm stressing like while we are talking about a specific painted peri project like our bet on them and what we have shared or what neila has shared about the strategic vision she's working with her board on it's at least three schools in next five years elementary schools so and like looking at the authorization landscape if anyone can do it it could be it can only be dssd at that scale that's why like putting more time in like figuring out the design for this so that it can become the blueprint for their growth is is something that lydia and i are kind of trying to figure out how to get them comfortable with with this model yeah yeah you know saddam's in town next week would it be eric eric wanted to follow up should i follow up and see if maybe that's a time for at least john to do a handshake or should we wait a little bit either way like if either way i don't my guess is like yeah relationship building never hurts so if that works out it's fine but again like i don't want to assume anything right you know yeah yeah okay okay your face said it all no but also i'm i'm just trying to figure out like is there another purpose right for this meeting i was not sure that's why but again like super aligned with nella on this she is there we did a full session with their whole c team on this and after the meeting when the rest of their c team left nella was like i want to make it happen like help me figure out how to get around this expectation setting you know it's not a bad idea if john's got time on his calendar because because of all of john's experience and all of our other reasons right they specifically said sort of the blueprint methodology when we're being creative and hunting down sites and trying to figure out how to make things work so i think if he has to yeah alan dar it's not a bad idea to set that up just again to build relationships so sadanche you and i talk about that with you know and run it past lydia says i know john was coming out to see lydia but if lydia's not going to be available he was not going to come out so i just need to make sure that if we're going to set something up it's you know using his time wise what i keep is going to fly out here yeah i think fifteenth is the only one i'm on road i'll be in fort collins most of the day but fourteenth or sixteenth works well yeah but lydia but i know lydia can sing in the text saying she may not be available at all next week so if that's what he was thinking about maybe not coming out next week so ok so i guess if he's not coming out now we can do bit of groundwork with nick and then kind of wherever john is here next like we can set that timer out there i'd rather you have that groundwork put together so when he comes out it's going to be a really good conversation what do you think yeah i think i think that makes sense because i still see like there are one or two steps with nick to like move forward with that because even like for him to be like yeah let's let's go and see more schools like i'm like let's do like little bit at least one conversation with him yeah a little bit yeah he had a lot of questions but jacob and i really connected you know just because i think he's overseeing all the construction and that sort of thing so he had a lot more detailed questions than eric did i don't know if you've met jacob yet or not that's their director facilities or i can't remember what his title was okay so okay so i'm not gonna respond i'm not gonna follow no i i i will loop you in in my email to nick and we will we can have we can find time so that's one and then scarlett i'll share the wildflower model with you was there anything else and then yeah joy i will do the follow up with header at grove elementary and then loop you in so that you can follow up with so now who's at grover grove is the balswan balswan spin out yeah deb was the one who reached out yeah so debbie basically like that's what the separation that they did was that they're going for this charter independently they're board and they have hired a new leader to lead that debbie's is only looking at the ball zone for now okay good okay okay wow accomplished a lot sorry we stayed over a little bit but it's good information yeah no i i mean i really appreciate the dsst brainstorming i think that could be a big one if we are able to to like get them over the line yeah yeah appreciate it cool okay so clear next steps i will follow up then and i'll let you know where to find out on the montrose call yeah yeah that was the other one but yeah i'll i'll also see like if we follow up with them based on school leader hiring a pajama or elisa anisa yeah alyssa yeah okay i just know donna donna's just the one that keeps calling me so oh okay do you want to be looked in on that you mean just send you an invite just in case no not yet because we haven't engaged with them on the grant yet like i think for us like the two gating questions on leader and student demographics based on that we'll figure out how much to lean in you tell me it would be like over fifty percent because there's a is there an industry a town that's not very far from montrose that has what is it like a plant or something and that's so the demographics there hispanics is very high and so i don't know if she was telling you about that or not so i'll get all the information and send you my notes sounds good awesome all right anything else scarlett you got anything no that's a lot it's a lot perfect your grilling this is exciting to me though yeah the dsst is interesting to me you know i'm trying to help them problem solve something especially just having a more established cmo that probably has a stronger you know balance sheet would be good to add to the portfolio all right okay you guys have a good good evening now for us it's four thirty here we have a couple hours left yes all right thank you bye",

        "summary": "This was a comprehensive project pipeline review meeting between Blueprint and CSF (Charter School Financing) stakeholders. The discussion covered multiple charter school facility projects across Colorado, including updates on Hierarchies, Wildflower expansion plans, and potential new engagements with Compass Academy, Montrose Classical, Grove Elementary (Balswan spin-out), and DSST's K-12 expansion. Key focus areas included aligning on investment criteria, exploring financing options, and strategizing on how to support schools seeking affordable facility solutions outside the traditional district construction model.",
        "keyDiscussionPoints": "Hierarchies Update: Project moving forward with Malt as GC contractor; total cost $650K with Laurel paying back $325K via lease agreement. Waiting on permits but confident of January occupancy to meet CSI agreement timeline. School showing strong academic performance during site visit.\n\nWildflower Network Structure & Financing: Wildflower operates as separate state entities (Wildflower Schools of Colorado has two charters). Financial analysis shows they can support up to $2.4M in financing for the Grand Junction church acquisition and renovation ($1.5M acquisition, $900K renovation). Church asking price is $3.4M but market value around $900K-$1.1M. Wildflower typically finances $150K-$180K for leasehold improvements through their foundation at 7-7.5% interest or previously through Jane (no longer doing construction loans).\n\nCompass Academy (DPS): Alternative middle school with declining enrollment (now 200 students) due to DPS taking away 2-3 classrooms annually from shared high school space. Single-digit proficiency rates present barrier for CSF grant funding and financing through CDFIs, though project management services may be possible. Looking for Southwest Denver location near transit for long-term lease using available funds for tenant improvements.\n\nMontrose Classical Academy: Charter recently approved by state with conditions after district appeal. Community-driven classical model with 216 letters of intent. Key concerns: no school leader hired yet (possibly Alyssa who led charter campaign), and enrollment policy unclear regarding serving diverse student populations in affluent area. CSF waiting on leader hire before proceeding with diligence or grant approval. School has $1.1M CSP funding approved and exploring church or office building options.\n\nGrove Elementary (Balswan spin-out): Restructured as independent charter with licensing agreement from Balswan (not full non-profit/public school intermingling). Looking at Westminster, Adams 12, and Jeffco districts for 250-300 student K-8 facility. Exploring temporary spaces requiring renovation while navigating district enrollment and facility availability constraints. Balswan leadership (Deb) reached out for facility support.\n\nDSST K-12 Expansion: Highest-performing 6-12 network in Colorado (16 Denver schools, 2 Aurora schools) exploring first K-12 campus in Aurora's Painted Prairie development with donated 13-acre site. Challenge: internal \"curse of prior expectations\" around $50-55M district-built facilities versus more affordable $20-25M charter-developed model. CEO Nella (from Yes Prep Texas) pushing for faster, more affordable approach while internal team (Nick) stuck in district construction mindset. This could be blueprint for 3+ elementary schools over 5 years. Qualifies for CSGF Dell Capitalist Fund if project budget is reasonable.\n\nZapier/Jane Financing Updates: Jane no longer doing construction loans, only $900K-$1M remaining for line of credit against CSP grants (not construction). This affects multiple schools' financing strategies.\n\nCSF Investment Criteria Alignment: Need consistency in pipeline evaluation. Academic performance is key barrier even for sourcing CDFI financing. Project management services can be offered when investment doesn't fit criteria, but schools must be along mission.",

      "audioTranscript": "i heard karma talking about some cookies before i joined i don't know what they're talking about sorry we got a school fundraiser coming up my niece is baking cookies oh nice i'm not cooking about yes she's making about triple of what's needed so sorry about that i just heard how many she was planning and had to pretty much we don't need that many so sedans we're still on for next week yeah still on for next week i just got back from only because she's got some a family thing happening yeah and so i'm just going to add it so she can make it then it sounds like she may not be able to make it on wednesday for the lunch but just so she can come to either one yeah okay yeah do you know i mean she might be on on tuesday again like this family stuff like it's taking she doesn't know exactly at what time she needs to be out so that's why she's kind of keeping calendar open for now okay well i'll add her to our coffee if that works yeah and if she's out that whole week totally understand family first okay so lydia and i just got back from fair play hierarchies hi rob is it actually on my list yeah okay sounds good we can start we can go through the our pipeline but really i have three things that really wanted to cover today yeah one is it one is wildflower for sure kyrocky is just kind of an update on where that airs yeah and then i want to talk about csf's pipeline to ensure that we're consistent in our who are you know talking to yeah there were two schools that i had which recent conversations so we can we can talk through that okay so real quick update on hierarchies i've met with them laurel meeting with her separately because you know we're acting more in the tenant kind of a tenant rev role yeah malt is taking over so malt is going to have a contract with the gc they will pay the full six hundred fifty thousand and laurel they're they'll have by the end of this week their lease agreement which will show that laurel will be paying back three hundred twenty five thousand pursuant to whatever the terms are i haven't seen a little lease agreement yet i've seen the draft yet i should be getting that on friday ok yeah still waiting on permits on that one but malt is mil is working directly with the gc to get that they still talk to michael over at csi we're still confident that if we can get the permit in the next week or so that we will have them in but at first week of january which will be you know in alignment with the csi agreement which is they only have once this one semester to you know work out of the garage and the boys and girls club and the library so we feel like we'll have them yeah because it's all interior work so even though it's horrible snow up there it's all interior work so we should be ok ok ok that's great yeah we saw the school like again compared to all our visits like this was one of the strong starts they have like again like for first thirty minutes it took lydia and me like some adjustment to see the outdoor education model and get used to it but like when they were actually doing the projects doing math and reading like i think that was pretty good and then enrollment wise also like i think they are pretty on track so yeah no thanks for your support on the facilities or like at least the tenant we cite as they figure this out because yeah one thing we were discussing about like once it snows like what is your plan like because right now most of the time kids were outside like pretty much a whole time we were there kids were outside so it'll be interesting once the weather probably next two three weeks it will start yeah yeah i was in bail last weekend and there was already snail on the mountain yeah so it's coming yeah it'll hit hierarchies where it gets the rest of us are you going to want to see any documents is there any compliance documents anything that csf is interested in seeing no contract i'm good yeah yeah anything else on hierarchies no nothing else they'll probably start evaluating some of the pre k sites for the next year but she wants to get done with this first okay yeah the next one i wanted to talk about is wildflowers so i've tried quite a few calls and scarlett this is kind of for you as well i know you're listening but just perfect your ears up on this one so i've been dealing with you know you know kelly over there at wildflower and rachel i guess my question is they were telling me that is their understanding that they have two point four million dollars to either buy the church and do renovations so one point five for the church nine hundred thousand for renovations or if the church actually gets sold because there is another church that's actually looking at it right now they have that money that they can go and either buy something do a long term lease that sort of thing so i guess my question is and scarlett please jump in because you make sure i'm asking this correctly their understanding is they got the two point four million dollars information from you saying you would do a financial analysis so can you share that with us some support as well yeah i can share that so after i did the whole model for them both for their grand valley and aurora campuses so we used that as the base and then the only change to that model was that initially they had thought about different sites in grand valley similar to aurora but the change here is that they were thinking of doing the whole pre k eight here with like one hundred ten students so like that is the only change but i can i can share that analysis with you all ok so i've met with kelly for the grand junction at the church to expand that to pre k eight and now i'm meeting with alexi who is also going to come to grand junction and open a pre k one so i'm what i'm trying to do just full transparency is i'm going to put together some sort of contract so i don't know if it's going to be per school but the questions we had was you know how their schools work on separate operating budgets right yeah so the analysis that i did was only for this site which this church site yeah for ms site with with the assumption that they will go to one hundred ten students is where we what they had shared with me and savant to the two point four million that they can is that what they have that's cash available or that's total no that will have to be financed as well yeah that'll have to be financed so they can afford two point four million in indent yeah up to yeah up to that but that that is all in like including financing fees and everything like the total total project cost which includes like if if they like the acquisition cost and the renovation cost plus whatever the financing and everything that is required i see and okay so you can send over yeah i can i can share that analysis yeah which we which i did with emma and rachel were on the call so i pressure tested the assumptions with them around staffing and other things so i can i can share that with you okay and then do you know if they had equity to bring to a project they'll have to fundraise for that okay and what's the acquisition price on this church joy we put an l o i n for nine hundred thousand because that was actually market value but they're asking three point four okay yeah i know so waiting to hear back from the the broker called our broker and said hey you're crazy do you want to sharpen your pencil and our broker came back and said here are all the comps of all the churches commercial office everything that is sold in the last three years the highest is you know at whatever the square footage was which brings it to you know one point one i think was it and we went in at nine hundred and so we're waiting for that response back from reviewing all of our because he did he said well look if you go to the comps please send those to me that i missed so that was what we're waiting for the concert bring it to three point four million dollars so don't you all have you can you explain to me a little bit about this foundation structure so they had there's a foundation yeah no so so so there is a wildflower foundation which is a national organization now that foundation is basically similar to the kip foundation you you like that's the parallel so they don't run regions like regions are their own like how kip la or kip socal and others are there so wildflower schools of colorado is the entity that is operating schools here in other states where they so only in three states they are operating it as a charter in all other states it's more of a private school or or esa or other other options but only in three states dc minnesota and here are they they are operating as charters so so just for colorado like wildflower schools of colorado is the single entity that has both charters both aurora one and the grand junction one and that entity is that that entity has a single pnl like even though they have to report it like their internal philosophy is that they do a pnl by or budgeting by each center but it all rolls up into a single charter so so that is where like for that that was my question for them like which entity or like which unit should we underwrite is it like just this particular site or like your entire wildflower schools of colorado because that's the five hundred one c three who will be the borrower in in in this case so that is separate entity from the because you mentioned in other states they are yeah each state is a separate entity and then the foundation is basically another entity now the role of the foundation is basically the model providing professional development of teachers help in setting up a new region plus the wildflower has also received csp funding like for all charter schools for all all region charter schools so they have allocated certain csp to colorado charter schools so so they they basically are administering that and then the other role which also wildflower foundation plays is provide financing for upfront like construction which one of their sites in aurora took that financing but realized like their interest rate was even higher than what they were getting otherwise so so they're not borrowing on behalf of the school they're actually lending to the schools they are not borrow yeah foundation is not borrowing on behalf of the school that's lending to the to the to the regions yeah and i think i remember hearing their rate was around seven percent seven and a half yeah submit yeah wouldn't you model the two point four based on the two point four was based on a lower ppr but overall like blended rate of six and a half percent six and a half are you loading any money or any the funds that you've got so don't you go into the new ece one that the lady named lexi that i met with that she's putting in grand junction have you talked to kelly about that one so we basically have given a multi year grant to wildflower for their expansion so we basically like which which like full expansion to i think across both aurora and grand junction they have three hundred the charters approved for three hundred sixty or something students so we have given them full grants like but it's a multi year grant based on the milestones that they'll open these sites so once they have the leader or the teacher leader and the site identified we provide them the grant for the next site okay so we don't do loans it's it's only the grant that we have given them did i hear you say that so they have two charters one in aurora and one grand junction or they're operating under a single chart so there are two charters like two charters approved but but like it is more similar to like the lea is basically a single lea like in some states each charter is a separate lea like in california here like you can have overall lea and then multiple charters under that so that is how the structure is very flat schools of colorado is the lea that has two charters got it got it and this is a new school that has yet to start with students no they already have the grand junction school which it's in the same site that pre k through third during a church and they had the first right to expand to four through six okay this church has now filed it's not filed bankruptcy yet but they've got to sell the church because they're going under got it so they're offering that church site yeah that's blind site they're starting to get ready to open a second site they've got a new teacher leader she wants to do just the ecek one and then her kids would would go up to third grade but then they would funnel ended up four through sixth grade at the other grand junction site if that makes sense i just met with her on friday so so that's what i'm trying to yeah and then the aurora i have i've done three there and we have just one more we're doing expansion on one right now and then we'll do we'll add another in aurora but the most they can have with all of those is three hundred sixty eight something like that but then they're charters and so don't you just want to make sure we're aligned so it's given that csf is providing operating grants for growth this is i assume this is one that you would like us to consider for investment again if it fits your model like i mean hierarchies also we were providing but like want to make sure that it it fits your underwriting framework as well yeah yeah okay we'll have a look at it i'm just thinking like based on current size of how we size investments it wouldn't amount to much as we're only talking about you know less than three hundred thousand dollars be two hundred seventy five thousand for one hundred ten students but actually so sudansha if you could just send me the projections yeah i'll do that projections and the aquad yeah all right cool because i do think it's we're at the point now where they're asking enough questions that i think it's time for us to you know for crystal and i have a conversation i think once she's looked at the financials with the leadership of wildflower at least kelly their executive director i need to set up project man i need to start set up pmas with them knowing now what they want to do but also they're asking about financing okay okay anything else on wildflower where i move maybe not no it's just that like timeline wise joy like yeah still tbd right based on what church comes back with and if it is still within that okay yes so if the church comes back and they say we'll take the one million then we move forward and we'll literally have to jump on that because i want to close pretty quickly they have sold that three acres in the back to colorado housing resources so they're going to build on that three acres we got to do replading and that sort of thing but they're they're going to build some townhomes and things like ten or twelve townhomes got it and then scott just for context so for the other sites wildflower correct me if i'm wrong but other sites are mostly like this those are least space where wildflower has raised around like whatever they have financed around two hundred fifty k two hundred two hundred fifty k of financing to do the improvements some kind of improvements there so typically what i do is i have to keep my improvements anywhere between one hundred sixty and one hundred eighty yeah so depending on the size you know if it's the ece or you know if it's the one through three the fourth roof k because it build them out you know in chunks so i have to definitely keep it below two hundred but usually one hundred sixty to one hundred eighty is what i could keep it at and they've typically gone through jane yeah so they had we're going to go through jane with the last one meadow rue and there were some miscommunication things didn't happen so that's why they went with the foundation at seven percent or seven but maybe for seven and a half and maybe seven so yeah i i didn't see the loan disrupted their operating budget but so i don't know if meadow rue the second half that reach out to jane but so i said yeah so that's i'm trying to think i know they haven't reached out to for cactus bloom and i don't think they're going to reach out to jane for this other new one in she hasn't decided what flower she's going to be yet so let's see so yeah i know so all of wildflowers named after a flower every one of their schools so they're they could pick their flower so so yeah so she hasn't decided she's going to yes in the past scarlet like that is how they have like that's the size around one hundred eighty one hundred fifty to one hundred eighty k is what they have financed for leasehold improvements but this one this site would but like most of those sites have had like smaller enrollment overall this one is like more doing the whole pre k through six now and then pre k through eight once they get the charter approved amended sorry you fill the church up you know the sanctuary they've always got you know we already had to the drawings done with the you know with the you know based on the lace we were able to expand but now that they're selling it we're having to wait sit on it so they have a k eight model and they have an established ka model in aurora it sounds like and they operate that k eight on multiple sites yeah yeah so their model basically is that they do like an easy a lower elementary and upper elementary so that's their model because they want to keep it micro sites so in aurora they have like the one cluster which is pre k or like ece then ece as in like whatever early childhood to like kindergarten and then first to third and then three to five yeah that one and then and then they are doing like a another aurora replication for this but in grand junction because of the demographic and like how it is like they wanted to do it all at once side versus like three different sites for one tree one k through six which which is something that we have been telling them because from financial stability and then also from governance or one teacher leader to be the entrepreneur and accountable for academic outcomes that works better so we we feel like this at least one hundred ten is better than like thirty thirty thirty twenty kind of yeah okay so in aurora they're doing like a thirty thirty thirty yeah like again exactly yeah somewhere around that yeah yeah yeah yeah got it okay that's helpful thank you the model i'll send like it it has all the details of like how much is the capacity of each of the sites and those yeah okay okay let's see we're about halfway i was just gonna give you a heads up i've got a couple of new rules that i'm working on yeah i think we took this one last time we were together compass academy dps yeah looked at their numbers i think you know i've scheduled a call for crystal and i to meet with their executive director to go over her findings i think it may turn into just project management but i'll let you know yeah i know you had said that you guys have looked at yeah we we looked at compass we visited their site i think their academics are not there where we would be working with them so yeah yeah so and we're hoping to find out what the numbers are going to be you know break it south from last year i think we had last year's numbers but yeah so they they definitely have the money and they do want to find something that they can grow dps cut them down again three more classrooms so their enrollment has continued to leak on down because dps keeps taking more and more space away from them at that high school can i ask george i don't know if you know how how that allocation works but is is the loss of space a result of declining enrollment or is it that dps has taken the class from away and therefore they're losing enrollment yeah the latter yeah so dps has they're part of a high school so because they're a middle school and they got put in the bottom level of the high school so the high school continues to grow and so every year they take like two classrooms two classrooms and this year they took three so they had to actually tell some students they had to go to their home it's an alternative middle school they actually told some of the students they had to go back to their home home middle schools they and sorry just trying to reconcile how that there is no obligation from the district side to accommodate the current enrollment they can just produce the classrooms and they have to reduce their enrollment yes that's what i'm hearing from their executive director so good crystal and i are gonna kind of get to the bottom of it we have a meeting with him and the idea here they're trying to get off that campus i'm assuming yes yes stay in the same southwest area because they need to be close to the buses and the train station and that sort of thing obviously because that's where majority of their students are coming from so they've asked if i would help them try to find a location in that area and maybe do a long term lease because they were looking at purchasing i think what was it two or three million dollars they had him on hand or something so but i'm gonna let crystal have that conversation i'll be on the call and if we can help them financially great if not they definitely need project management so i'll just one quick second so yeah just aligned on what joy shared like their enrollment has come down and is now at two hundred students overall and then looking at their academic performance is why we kind of like this is their district so like it was single digit proficiency so that's why we we have not engaged with them so far yeah andre said there's an alternative school yeah middle school yeah and it took demographic to serve yeah and chris will take early on already because of academic performance is that we would be unlikely to invest in this or we could do project management yeah i think though i'd like for her to hear the story you know and we could definitely source financing we just may not be able to give financing ourselves right so i've heard brandon to feel like he's heard because he was the one that was bounced around on to everybody and he finally found me and he was like finally somebody that can like tell me what i need to do and so what i want to do is have him feel like he's been heard and then if we can't help him financially that's fine but maybe we can source financing we definitely could do project management but i do think it's along our definitely along our mission of helping the students yeah yeah enjoy when you connect with crypto i'm sure she'll go over but sooner that's sagashi notice that the academics will be a barrier even for sourcing financing from a number of our partners and cdfi the chief financing like they're all going to have pause at that and so just to be aware that even that will be it's not easy thing to secure so what i'm hoping is and i've been looking with a real estate agent i'm hoping there are some buildings in that area that are a little run down but i'm hoping if maybe we can do a long term lease we can use some of those funds to do tenant improvements to be able to use it as a school so i'm hoping and then at that point they wouldn't have to source any financing right so i don't know i'm just i just i'm just trying to find a way to help them out and even if we're no but even if we're just working with him taking through the process so that he gets smart on kind of how all that works and can can know how to better position school even in the future i think it's it's worthwhile that's part that's part of the mission as well so yes certainly worth the time and then the other one real quick because i want to get to years montrose classical so that you know i've been in touch with them really since you guys put me in touch with them they came back that the board i think you know the state board of education senate backed the mantra okay so they that they voted to approve their charter with conditions i don't know if you talked to don or not so you're shaking your head so maybe you already know all this so don and i've been in conversation and so i am going to be scheduling a meeting with donna and hopefully crystal i've got to get some dates back at times to meet so they want to hire us for our services and i don't know if it's going to be they reach out to jane and this is another i've got i'm having coffee with jane next week because i just don't understand based on all the conversations we've had they were they were told by jane that they're not loaning out money anymore but yet i thought on that call we had the jane they were learning money just short term yeah but like this is also very small size loans it won't be for construction like they only have one million dollars left from daniel's fund so so they are only doing those line of credit against csp kind of like two years right yeah that was the line of credit not the construction loan so they are not doing any any more construction yeah okay they don't have like they i think they only have left nine hundred k or or a million up to a million that was a grant from daniels not the pri okay they got one point one as a csp approved montrose did again according to donna so i put her in touch with and thanks for the when i was it you or was it peter somebody introduced me to marco so i went and had breakfast with margot last week she's a senior vice president alpine you know who's handling all of those the daniel fund so i'll put them in touch with her as well she said that she spoke to the league yesterday she has indana and that the lady said everything's on hold because of the shutdown so she was going to reach out and talk to margo no funds are being moved given reimbursed nothing so but anyway so that's another one that i don't know if we'll do financing i do want to hear her story and then talk to them a little bit more they've got a church and an office building that they're looking at right now obviously the office building would need more ti than the church so yeah so i can i can give you a little bit more context on the school and like our conversations with them so far so montrose classical i think like this has been like a more of a community initiative like their families have come together and they want the classical model in montrose again it has been a long fight for them to get denied by district go to state appeal and then get approved there so they have done like a lot of work with them like for us like the biggest question for them was the student population that they're going to serve while there is an intent to serve high like more diverse student population their enrollment policy or like some of the things that we have discussed with them it's not clear of like how they are going to do that again knowing the location knowing how they are going about it like this might be the option where like more affluent families sign up for the school and like it resonates with them especially because it's also a classical model and like so far the effort has been from the families that are more affluent while so so that is where we are we have left with them and the second thing is that they have not identified the school leader yet like who's going to be the academic vision holder or school person who will run the school so two things where we are like working with them on one is who's the school leader because the student demographics that they serve in the long term like will also be tied to like what's the vision of that leader and how much effort they are putting to make this school more diverse and then the second thing is like yeah just figuring out how this yeah how the enrollment for their founding year because they're still looking to launch next year so how how that holds up so right now we haven't finalized if we are doing a grant or a full diligence with them unless they have like without leader like we have never done a diligence or approved a grant so so that would be that would be like i think the main holding point for us till they identify the leader and then the demographics yeah so donna who's the president of school board yeah she said that she wants to meet either thursday or friday they said they have two hundred sixteen letters of intent for her families yeah and i would be meeting with her in the new principal so i shouldn't say it the leader was a principal is it alyssa is it alisa or somebody or is that another leader no there's another person who's working on who worked with them to get through the charter and everything at least like last week from what i heard from lydia's conversations from last friday i don't think they have hired like a school principal maybe somebody else on the board yeah alyssa is the person who we have been engaging with as she ran the whole campaign got parents together and did the state board of what's her name alyssa yes yes yeah okay so if you're meeting her like again she's great and if she becomes the school leader that would even be better because she's she's most aligned on in terms of student demographics she would like the school to serve okay but i like at least till last week she had not finalized if she will be the school leader okay now do you have any documentation because i did tell her that if we were going to meet with crystal that i was going to need to see financials she said she had every bit of that like five year financials five year enrollment analysis she said she had anything i needed she said she could send to me do you no i i don't have no it's probably the work that they did for their charter application so might be worth looking at it yeah good sorry joy so on friday i thought they didn't have the charger so in the last couple of days they did get a charter approved yeah there is verbally approved at the twenty third board meeting and it's approved with conditions like a traffic study so that's why donna called me she was like i need you to help me and she said you know if i need to hire you how does that work with blueprint so scarlett charter is approved the leader is not hired right the leader's not hired okay yeah we were talking on friday the charter was not approved either okay also the charter is basically they sent it back to the district to approve like state said that yeah this should be approved the sent it back to the district district is basically just playing ball in finalizing the contract so those bunch of conditions yeah because they don't want a charter school yeah so they've added they're making it difficult yeah to make it difficult classical's first school right this is a brand new school yeah all right so whatever i find out on that donkey or whatever information i get from donna or elise or alyssa whatever the name is i'll just share it with you yeah and then yeah once we have more conversations around the school leader and others i'll keep you posted based on what we discussed okay okay okay that's what i had what do you have for me so the one that i have this was the conversation i had yesterday grove elementary which is bal swan has surfaced she reached out to me yeah so that has surfaced again and i told her yesterday of like so i think that the new update or a good update is basically like they are not planning this project like with the whole bal swan umbrella like this is a this is a separate charter because when they got denied last year one of the feedback from boulder valley district was that hey there is this non profit and there is this public school funding this public non public intermingling of funds they were not clear about the governance structure so what they basically have done is have like a more independent charter with a licensing agreement with balswan so there will be more like the model sharing the professional development but like no significant and then their foundation might also help them with the fundraising stuff but not like an official part of the same five hundred one c three entity that they were initially envisioning so this charter will be filed separately now now they basically are figuring out this three dimensional chess of the district to apply for this charter where the facilities available and where there is growing enrollment again enrollment is not as big of a challenge for them because of the student population they are targeting i think for them the more thing they basically are trying to figure out the facility option so they they they now are not tied to like just bvsd they are looking at westminster which is only like eight minute drive from there less than my they are looking at adams twelve and they are also looking at jeffco they have looked at some of the some of the facilities through the broker again they haven't they don't have an exclusive contract but they were looking at certain properties and they said that like all these all these church or like these temporary spaces are requiring some kind of renovation so they were trying to understand of like even if it's a temporary or a long term lease like what are the options do they do they have if they are not going with the grounds up build like what kind of temporary facilities that they can get into so what i shared with them they're looking forward like a thirty fifty thousand i mean like a normal kindergarten i mean an elementary school yeah like a normal elementary school and i think their their charter would be around two hundred fifty to three hundred students is what three hundred yeah maximum of up to three hundred students but again like yeah so so now like at least based on this new like this charter school board that they have the discussions that they have had they are more aligned on like yeah it has to be an independent space not part of this whole twenty thirty million dollar project we know like we have to be in like a affordable facility they also are have gotten a round of like grounds up build is not possible but now what are the options that they have is something that they need help trying to figure out and then also like she reached out to me on my old company email oh okay probably responded to her from blueprint she was like oh let me get some more information i'll check back in with you and i haven't heard back from her so yeah yeah yeah so i think like i think initially like it it would be again they don't have the charter approved yet but like for the charter they need to show like these are the two three options or this is the strategy that they'll go after and then depending on the facility they would like to have they would like to figure out which which district to apply to okay do you want me to reach back out to her do you want to i know there's not an e introduction needed but do you want to somehow connect us again yeah because i had the conversation yesterday i'll just like send like yeah a reintroduction there because you know westminster i got a call from you know we're we're buying the aak building from cec right so mark who's executive director over at cec for the facilities they're getting ready to sell that high school in westminster oh okay yeah they're getting rid of it so that might be an option for them but i think it's probably it's going to be probably way too big for an elementary school it's a it's a high school right now but but it's owned by cec yeah oh okay yes they're high school up there so i was supposed to go tour it probably sometime i want to go tour before i had to drive up to boulder i mean to westminster in the snow okay and then the last one is more of a brainstorming so i'll need more brain power here is figuring out dsst so yeah i met with them you met with nick okay yeah nick and jacob i went to a women's thing whatever over a glass of wine nella was like i need to hire you and i was like oh okay so i don't know if there's the line talking or she actually liked what i was telling her about you know what brent does but anyway the next day i get an email from nick and jacob and i went and spent about an hour with them just chit chatting about blueprint what blueprint does i didn't do like a full formal whatever because that was not like a i think it was more of a nail it wants us to meet you so we're going to meet you but then once i got in there they were like oh and realized you know that i knew what i was talking about jacob and i talked a lot about facilities cost of facilities i sent them a couple of things via email and just to hear back from them but they did also go meet with the developer and i don't know how that meeting went for some land out there in aurora out close to not at the airport but out that way painted prairie i think painting yeah painted something denver school of science and technology so they are the biggest network here in colorado so let me give you like a little more context and like where i need i would love to work yeah because that is that i guess is door to more like working with the network so dsst they have i think sixteen schools here in denver and two schools in aurora right now it's the highest performing sixth through twelve in the entire state i think twelve of their sixteen schools were like blue ribbon or like what whatever the count is so very high performing school grew very grew very pretty quickly in seventeen eighteen twenty seventeen eighteen time when denver was like more progressive and like wanted to have this portfolio approach so they basically have six through twelve schools so they run like middle school and then they started as a high school but now have like a six through twelve pipeline very strong financial position primarily because all their schools in denver were all district facilities and those district facilities were also like pretty big like soccer field and football field and others so and then they went to aurora in twenty twenty two so aurora basically had a partnership with them where they included them in the bond and then dsst and aurora's public schools foundation did a joint fundraising to have another thousand student six through twelve campus so that is the ast one project so lot of philanthropic organizations foundations here came together made that happen but and then they've got approved by aurora for two schools so this was one six through twelve and then another six through twelve campus but the second six route twelve campus it delay it has delayed twice already and now finally opening in twenty twenty eight because the board changed the superintendent changed everybody changed so now like and then even dsst there was a leadership change nella came from yes prep and she took over so the second school now finally got approved they have included them in their cop and like our aps board has also approved so they will be locating with another high school that is coming up for aps so they are going with the second school also but the total project budget for this school excluding all the shared space that they will have all the soccer field and everything is fifty five million dollars forty five fifty to fifty five million dollars so fifty eight yeah so fifty fifty eight probably yeah crazy yeah so the deal is basically they are going for cop with aurora which will raise around forty forty five million dollars and they are jointly raising twelve million dollars to make this work as a fundraising piece again this is a separate project not through this the reason i was giving this context is that here we are dealing with the curse of prior expectations which is we are used to these forty fifty sixty million dollar buildings what do we do now now and that is where nick has been with the organization for so long i think he is still in that mental block of like how does it work on a lower budget or like how do we do this yeah how do we make it work kind of like if and then so but nela who is the new ceo she comes from yesterday from texas context she wants to run quickly like how texas is used to and yes prep has grown over time she has her expectations that she is like building is not my program i am very flexible it is just the internal team and change management that she has to manage so now this painted query like this is the third aurora campus that has come up the developer really wants them there and dsst also wants to expand to full k through twelve instead of just six through twelve so this would be their first k through twelve campus they have never designed an elementary school before like all their schools both either district buildings or these new constructions have been through yeah have been basically like grounds of construction so they are open to do that but like they need to figure out like what is the path to that how much it is going to cost we are ready to adjust our design elementaries the new area for us we will ready to do that but right now they don't know how to do that and then nick also has this block of like how can it be done without spending fifty five million dollars lidan and i were brainstorming is one we have examples from idaho where folks are doing rounds of build gem prep has done k through twelve pre k through twelve and their buildings are costing somewhere around twenty to twenty two million dollars and then with developer partnership developer is basically donating the land and all the site improvements so around four to five million dollars three to four million dollars are getting reduced there so school is only financing seventeen eighteen million dollars total currently so which works out for them around fifteen percent of the ppr so those were one examples that i am planning to share with them but i am pretty sure you all might have like many more examples from california texas others were like even if it s a grounds up build and you want to have certain standards fifty five million dollars price tag is something i'm finding it difficult to wrap my head around so i think part of it is urgency around like this developer conversation has opened up now and they want to figure out how to have a k eight or k through twelve there but it has to be more aurora doesn t have capacity unless they go for a new bond next to do this so they are trying to figure out like if dsst has to do it on its own how would that work and then what is the design what is the budget that they can get to so they always start with the building and this fifty five million dollars we have to figure out for them or with them is that what is the realistic number that they can still get to without taking out all the bells and whistles soccer field so this was for expansion to a third campus near aurora yeah it is a new development yeah private site or would it be the districts of inviting land for it most probably the developer will providing the land for you thirteen acres and the developer they are building so many homes they would donate the land donate the land yeah with lisa at a very low for dsst before so they have done with oakwood homes with awkward homes in green valley ranch they have done this model before where developer because they are such high performing schools developer has an incentive to bring them in so that they can sell more homes right but certainly it is land is near free we'll say yeah the land acquisition does not need to be accounted for as part of the budget right now the other thing we talked about sadanche we talked about the one with the painted prairie developer out there but we also talked about a possible k five or k eight for about one thousand two hundred students with that with this k twelve yeah i think it s that the same it s the same one they wouldn t build just in elementary they just do the whole k twelve ideally yes yeah ideally ok yeah because he talked to me about if they look at a k pop or a k eight if we talk about different land we talked about lotus for one thousand two hundred students around seventy thousand square feet but i talked to them the morning and that afternoon is when they all met with painted prairie so you've probably talked to them since they had the meeting with painted yeah yeah i think that conversation they were like yeah this conversation has opened up again like how do we figure out if dsst has to go by its own without any district bond support is that right no that was going to be for the k eight what sfk twelve total i don't know what the k what would the k twelve bed so they typically have around five hundred students in six through eight and then around another five hundred in nine through twelve and then k through five i think they are counting seven hundred so if they re only doing k through eight then it will be one thousand two hundred and if it s k sorry k through eight it will be one two hundred and if it s k through twelve like yeah around seventeen ok and then joy you said that seventy thousand was for the possibly k pop or a k eight because twelve n yeah but a lot of that was just well we're meeting with the developer this afternoon we ll get back with you so it sounds like they did meet with the developer and decided on k twelve it might be k eight joy i think this is just again design phase or iteration phase so they might only think of k eight right now and do nine through twelve later maybe second third phase thirteen acres out there if they needed to and the developer is just providing the land or is the intention that the developer also has a team that s going to be doing the design construction all of that is it a package deal or are they free to develop however and with whoever they want on the land or is it my understanding is like that is to be negotiated if there s incentive and cost benefit for developer to do that we can propose that that is something that we can propose as a design of what we want and siranche you mentioned so there s this prayer there s this potential for this donated land from a developer and denver wants them to expand to throw to k twelve no so denver denver doesn t want them to grow nella wants to expand but in dps like getting a new charter approved is close to impossible so that s why and our advice to them was also like hey you are going into elementary for the first time don t do it as a turnaround because that s two x three x more harder than starting afresh so that s why they are prioritizing this k eight first get the model right for elementary school and then approach dps of like you have tens of low performing schools i think she ll give you a proof they bring enough money into dps yeah they can but i think for her it s getting the model right before they do that we did talk about that yeah and then she does want to go look at k eight s and things like that so with these sixteen schools i mean so yeah i'm just curious if they have been primarily operating on district land it sounds like they are having some bond issuances so they have borrowed money from the bottom so most of these schools are district facilities some of these are by them but like district has put in bond money or basically have bought and then leased it back to dsst so those are the things aurora like so the thing with this third school is aurora doesn t have capacity in their current bond to go after this school developer is basically like if i wait for aurora to pass the bond and like build this it will take them another five seven years they want to sell start selling the homes as soon as possible so they want to partner with dssd so they have an incentive to bring dssd in and that s why they are donating the land sst in your portfolio now they haven t opened a new school in last three years but we already pretty much have done the diligence for this second aurora school it s just that the facilities got finalized very recently and it will open in twenty twenty eight so we are not like it three years out right now so next spring is when we will basically provide them the grant for that school but if this third school happens sooner than that we pretty much are ready with our diligence to approve and then they are also part of csgf portfolio right ok and this school is not part of the growth plan so they will be fresh grant funding from charter school growth fund also once if this gets rolling ok so you are not sure if they have the right status in the csgf portfolio to qualify for the dell capitalist fund no they can qualify but they can qualify but then also not going with a fifty five million dollar quid it should be affordable so that criteria for the csgf yeah that's good to know in terms of sourcing financing for like a twenty million dollars project yeah no definitely i think they will looking at their financial health the fundraising that they'll bring into this and then the rest of it through financing i think we'll have to put the capital stack but right now i think the biggest thing that they have to figure out is that how to get it done in more reasonable like what should be the design how should we get it done incidentally there's you know there's a couple ways to approach that i think one of the ones we'll be going starting from affordability so what does it look like given their anticipated enrollment and all of that projections how much could they support when they don't have denver support and then that could drive ok well what type of budget are we talking about and that's not sufficient ok what type of fundraising are you looking at doing in addition to your school budgets yeah so i think that part is fine but i think where they are stuck is actually getting like ok they come up with a number let's say they can afford twenty five thirty million dollars let's say but their experience is like oh this can only be built for fifty million dollars and that's why they are stuck like i think what we need to or what we need to work with them on is that if they can afford thirty million how to get the design and build yeah how can we what design works for that and like how does that align with their model is where we need to work with them so we already have the target number then so target number i think we can quickly pull because they did that for their aurora campus anyway so we can we can get that number quickly and then we can also have like a plug for the fundraising stuff which again not worried about dsst and fundraising they have done twelve million for every building so very well respected yeah cml yeah so when i talk to eric and jacob they wanted me to set up some schools for them to go tour is that what you're hearing as well yeah that was again like lydia's suggestion to neila is that because neila is convinced she has worked at yes perhaps she knows how to get this done and this can happen yes prep has done that it's like the old guard the team that she needs to convince that this can be done so that's why she's like they were very surprised lotus for they were like is that just like paint on the walls and i'm like exactly right so that is the mindset that they are coming with so lydia basically told nella is like ask them to visit few schools and look at the design and like see that because they have not seen projects being done in thirty million dollars so yeah okay do you want me to follow back up with eric or is that a conversation look me in on think i think what would be helpful is you and i have a conversation with sit with nick share the examples of like what we have and then also like because right even sharing the examples won't convince because he'll be like oh those buildings are not per standards of dsst so we'll have to like figure out like what schools because that's why i was thinking of like going to idaho with nick but because of some of the traveling schedule it's not working out in the near term i do want to have a conversation with you about idaho too so at some point not today obviously maybe yeah because some i also need to figure out how did they get the two percent financing done in idaho recently i'm guessing it's usda but i don't know you know that's how atlas they got usda financing yeah yeah so yeah i think next steps on that joy let's you and i meet with nick my guess is that like this will require us to like work with the design firm or design architect firm to kind of create a plan with them and do the costing or make it with him whatever is the number for twelve hundred students it works out okay so are you thinking like i have some examples you know i've obviously have k twelve k eight that i've built from the ground up here in colorado i mean over the years would that be beneficial are these district if these are district buildings then i'm i don't know what their budget was and more recent i think like more like more charter examples which were done within okay that i think are the are the ones we need to but again like those examples would just be the starter like k eight shorter i haven't done a k twelve chart it'll be k twelve that i did was when i was douglas county school district we bought we built three of those and then the part two of that is more critical joy like is is there a design firm that we can work with to create initial designs and do the cost estimate without land if we have to do the cost estimate what what is that okay yeah i've got a couple of that i actually built the buildings at douglas county that i was really impressed with their their work so and i've used them since with charter schools so yeah so i guess like let's do that like let's let's meet with nick propose this strategy of like working with the design firm to get to the get to like what would it cost because another piece of it is also like when when they are going through the district and district is building all these fillings like they have to follow the prevailing wage and other things like that also increases the cost with twenty twenty five percent at least so that is also like another thing where we'll cut down the cost like if we go around that so we'll have to figure out like how to what's the cost of gate if we have to do it yeah i had asked them to send me the design they said it was a book the design book for dps for building schools yeah but yeah that's what we are that's what we have to push them on is like we are not going by dps design standards yeah that's what they were saying why it costs so much is because they had to follow the book of standards yeah because it was district building yes but now we have to get out yeah like if we come out of that and if we do it more grounds up and get rid of prevailing wage and like some of these design requirements like what would it cost so it's really just about helping them understand like private facilities can be done and they are often they are most often done with like half of what you've been doing with district facilities and here's what a twenty million dollars building could look like yeah because it may also be some expectation setting as well yes yes i think that change management soccer fields and gymnasium and stuff like that that may not be possible without submit for fundraisers but how do you build a project that accounts for that stuff that might happen later on right let's enter your building let's get you your core stuff and if you need a few years to fundraise to come back and add a gym to come back and add a field like how do we how do we plan an account for that in the conversations with the developer yeah like lotus is a good example i mean we're not going to be done with that for several months but right like school owned a site they have some play fields doing some new construction and so you can speak to sort of base development and different play in front of they go colorado examples i mean you can go to the blueprint website and look through like all of our projects see pictures of the types of schools that we've built number of classrooms square footage and get that book so started why i said like it was curse of prior expectation was also like what families were looking for is that if they open a new school five miles from their existing schools families would be like hey this building is very different like you don't offer soccer or whatever program here like why should i say but like now the window has opened up because they are doing elementary for the first time yeah so like for them also like how they position and market might change so this is a good option and while i'm stressing like while we are talking about a specific painted peri project like our bet on them and what we have shared or what neila has shared about the strategic vision she's working with her board on it's at least three schools in next five years elementary schools so and like looking at the authorization landscape if anyone can do it it could be it can only be dssd at that scale that's why like putting more time in like figuring out the design for this so that it can become the blueprint for their growth is is something that lydia and i are kind of trying to figure out how to get them comfortable with with this model yeah yeah you know saddam's in town next week would it be eric eric wanted to follow up should i follow up and see if maybe that's a time for at least john to do a handshake or should we wait a little bit either way like if either way i don't my guess is like yeah relationship building never hurts so if that works out it's fine but again like i don't want to assume anything right you know yeah yeah okay okay your face said it all no but also i'm i'm just trying to figure out like is there another purpose right for this meeting i was not sure that's why but again like super aligned with nella on this she is there we did a full session with their whole c team on this and after the meeting when the rest of their c team left nella was like i want to make it happen like help me figure out how to get around this expectation setting you know it's not a bad idea if john's got time on his calendar because because of all of john's experience and all of our other reasons right they specifically said sort of the blueprint methodology when we're being creative and hunting down sites and trying to figure out how to make things work so i think if he has to yeah alan dar it's not a bad idea to set that up just again to build relationships so sadanche you and i talk about that with you know and run it past lydia says i know john was coming out to see lydia but if lydia's not going to be available he was not going to come out so i just need to make sure that if we're going to set something up it's you know using his time wise what i keep is going to fly out here yeah i think fifteenth is the only one i'm on road i'll be in fort collins most of the day but fourteenth or sixteenth works well yeah but lydia but i know lydia can sing in the text saying she may not be available at all next week so if that's what he was thinking about maybe not coming out next week so ok so i guess if he's not coming out now we can do bit of groundwork with nick and then kind of wherever john is here next like we can set that timer out there i'd rather you have that groundwork put together so when he comes out it's going to be a really good conversation what do you think yeah i think i think that makes sense because i still see like there are one or two steps with nick to like move forward with that because even like for him to be like yeah let's let's go and see more schools like i'm like let's do like little bit at least one conversation with him yeah a little bit yeah he had a lot of questions but jacob and i really connected you know just because i think he's overseeing all the construction and that sort of thing so he had a lot more detailed questions than eric did i don't know if you've met jacob yet or not that's their director facilities or i can't remember what his title was okay so okay so i'm not gonna respond i'm not gonna follow no i i i will loop you in in my email to nick and we will we can have we can find time so that's one and then scarlett i'll share the wildflower model with you was there anything else and then yeah joy i will do the follow up with header at grove elementary and then loop you in so that you can follow up with so now who's at grover grove is the balswan balswan spin out yeah deb was the one who reached out yeah so debbie basically like that's what the separation that they did was that they're going for this charter independently they're board and they have hired a new leader to lead that debbie's is only looking at the ball zone for now okay good okay okay wow accomplished a lot sorry we stayed over a little bit but it's good information yeah no i i mean i really appreciate the dsst brainstorming i think that could be a big one if we are able to to like get them over the line yeah yeah appreciate it cool okay so clear next steps i will follow up then and i'll let you know where to find out on the montrose call yeah yeah that was the other one but yeah i'll i'll also see like if we follow up with them based on school leader hiring a pajama or elisa anisa yeah alyssa yeah okay i just know donna donna's just the one that keeps calling me so oh okay do you want to be looked in on that you mean just send you an invite just in case no not yet because we haven't engaged with them on the grant yet like i think for us like the two gating questions on leader and student demographics based on that we'll figure out how much to lean in you tell me it would be like over fifty percent because there's a is there an industry a town that's not very far from montrose that has what is it like a plant or something and that's so the demographics there hispanics is very high and so i don't know if she was telling you about that or not so i'll get all the information and send you my notes sounds good awesome all right anything else scarlett you got anything no that's a lot it's a lot perfect your grilling this is exciting to me though yeah the dsst is interesting to me you know i'm trying to help them problem solve something especially just having a more established cmo that probably has a stronger you know balance sheet would be good to add to the portfolio all right okay you guys have a good good evening now for us it's four thirty here we have a couple hours left yes all right thank you bye",

        "summary": "This was a comprehensive project pipeline review meeting between Blueprint and CSF (Charter School Financing) stakeholders. The discussion covered multiple charter school facility projects across Colorado, including updates on Hierarchies, Wildflower expansion plans, and potential new engagements with Compass Academy, Montrose Classical, Grove Elementary (Balswan spin-out), and DSST's K-12 expansion. Key focus areas included aligning on investment criteria, exploring financing options, and strategizing on how to support schools seeking affordable facility solutions outside the traditional district construction model.",
        "keyDiscussionPoints": [
          "Hierarchies Update: Project moving forward with Malt as GC contractor; total cost $650K with Laurel paying back $325K via lease agreement. Waiting on permits but confident of January occupancy to meet CSI agreement timeline. School showing strong academic performance during site visit.",
          "Wildflower Network Structure & Financing: Wildflower operates as separate state entities (Wildflower Schools of Colorado has two charters). Financial analysis shows they can support up to $2.4M in financing for the Grand Junction church acquisition and renovation ($1.5M acquisition, $900K renovation). Church asking price is $3.4M but market value around $900K-$1.1M. Wildflower typically finances $150K-$180K for leasehold improvements through their foundation at 7-7.5% interest or previously through Jane (no longer doing construction loans).",
          "Compass Academy (DPS): Alternative middle school with declining enrollment (now 200 students) due to DPS taking away 2-3 classrooms annually from shared high school space. Single-digit proficiency rates present barrier for CSF grant funding and financing through CDFIs, though project management services may be possible. Looking for Southwest Denver location near transit for long-term lease using available funds for tenant improvements.",
          "Montrose Classical Academy: Charter recently approved by state with conditions after district appeal. Community-driven classical model with 216 letters of intent. Key concerns: no school leader hired yet (possibly Alyssa who led charter campaign), and enrollment policy unclear regarding serving diverse student populations in affluent area. CSF waiting on leader hire before proceeding with diligence or grant approval. School has $1.1M CSP funding approved and exploring church or office building options.",
          "Grove Elementary (Balswan spin-out): Restructured as independent charter with licensing agreement from Balswan (not full non-profit/public school intermingling). Looking at Westminster, Adams 12, and Jeffco districts for 250-300 student K-8 facility. Exploring temporary spaces requiring renovation while navigating district enrollment and facility availability constraints. Balswan leadership (Deb) reached out for facility support.",
          "DSST K-12 Expansion: Highest-performing 6-12 network in Colorado (16 Denver schools, 2 Aurora schools) exploring first K-12 campus in Aurora's Painted Prairie development with donated 13-acre site. Challenge: internal \"curse of prior expectations\" around $50-55M district-built facilities versus more affordable $20-25M charter-developed model. CEO Nella (from Yes Prep Texas) pushing for faster, more affordable approach while internal team (Nick) stuck in district construction mindset. This could be blueprint for 3+ elementary schools over 5 years. Qualifies for CSGF Dell Capitalist Fund if project budget is reasonable.",
          "Zapier/Jane Financing Updates: Jane no longer doing construction loans, only $900K-$1M remaining for line of credit against CSP grants (not construction). This affects multiple schools' financing strategies.",
          "CSF Investment Criteria Alignment: Need consistency in pipeline evaluation. Academic performance is key barrier even for sourcing CDFI financing. Project management services can be offered when investment doesn't fit criteria, but schools must be along mission."

nice i'm not cooking about yes she's making about triple of what's needed so sorry about that i just heard how many she was planning and had to pretty much we don't need that many so sedans we're still on for next week yeah still on for next week i just got back from only because she's got some a family thing happening yeah and so i'm just going to add it so she can make it then it sounds like she may not be able to make it on wednesday for the lunch but just so she can come to either one yeah okay yeah do you know i mean she might be on on tuesday again like this family stuff like it's taking she doesn't know exactly at what time she needs to be out so that's why she's kind of keeping calendar open for now okay well i'll add her to our coffee if that works yeah and if she's out that whole week totally understand family first okay so lydia and i just got back from fair play hierarchies hi rob is it actually on my list yeah okay sounds good we can start we can go through the our pipeline but really i have three things that really wanted to cover today yeah one is it one is wildflower for sure kyrocky is just kind of an update on where that airs yeah and then i want to talk about csf's pipeline to ensure that we're consistent in our who are you know talking to yeah there were two schools that i had which recent conversations so we can we can talk through that okay so real quick update on hierarchies i've met with them laurel meeting with her separately because you know we're acting more in the tenant kind of a tenant rev role yeah malt is taking over so malt is going to have a contract with the gc they will pay the full six hundred fifty thousand and laurel they're they'll have by the end of this week their lease agreement which will show that laurel will be paying back three hundred twenty five thousand pursuant to whatever the terms are i haven't seen a little lease agreement yet i've seen the draft yet i should be getting that on friday ok yeah still waiting on permits on that one but malt is mil is working directly with the gc to get that they still talk to michael over at csi we're still confident that if we can get the permit in the next week or so that we will have them in but at first week of january which will be you know in alignment with the csi agreement which is they only have once this one semester to you know work out of the garage and the boys and girls club and the library so we feel like we'll have them yeah because it's all interior work so even though it's horrible snow up there it's all interior work so we should be ok ok ok that's great yeah we saw the school like again compared to all our visits like this was one of the strong starts they have like again like for first thirty minutes it took lydia and me like some adjustment to see the outdoor education model and get used to it but like when they were actually doing the projects doing math and reading like i think that was pretty good and then enrollment wise also like i think they are pretty on track so yeah no thanks for your support on the facilities or like at least the tenant we cite as they figure this out because yeah one thing we were discussing about like once it snows like what is your plan like because right now most of the time kids were outside like pretty much a whole time we were there kids were outside so it'll be interesting once the weather probably next two three weeks it will start yeah yeah i was in bail last weekend and there was already snail on the mountain yeah so it's coming yeah it'll hit hierarchies where it gets the rest of us are you going to want to see any documents is there any compliance documents anything that csf is interested in seeing no contract i'm good yeah yeah anything else on hierarchies no nothing else they'll probably start evaluating some of the pre k sites for the next year but she wants to get done with this first okay yeah the next one i wanted to talk about is wildflowers so i've tried quite a few calls and scarlett this is kind of for you as well i know you're listening but just perfect your ears up on this one so i've been dealing with you know you know kelly over there at wildflower and rachel i guess my question is they were telling me that is their understanding that they have two point four million dollars to either buy the church and do renovations so one point five for the church nine hundred thousand for renovations or if the church actually gets sold because there is another church that's actually looking at it right now they have that money that they can go and either buy something do a long term lease that sort of thing so i guess my question is and scarlett please jump in because you make sure i'm asking this correctly their understanding is they got the two point four million dollars information from you saying you would do a financial analysis so can you share that with us some support as well yeah i can share that so after i did the whole model for them both for their grand valley and aurora campuses so we used that as the base and then the only change to that model was that initially they had thought about different sites in grand valley similar to aurora but the change here is that they were thinking of doing the whole pre k eight here with like one hundred ten students so like that is the only change but i can i can share that analysis with you all ok so i've met with kelly for the grand junction at the church to expand that to pre k eight and now i'm meeting with alexi who is also going to come to grand junction and open a pre k one so i'm what i'm trying to do just full transparency is i'm going to put together some sort of contract so i don't know if it's going to be per school but the questions we had was you know how their schools work on separate operating budgets right yeah so the analysis that i did was only for this site which this church site yeah for ms site with with the assumption that they will go to one hundred ten students is where we what they had shared with me and savant to the two point four million that they can is that what they have that's cash available or that's total no that will have to be financed as well yeah that'll have to be financed so they can afford two point four million in indent yeah up to yeah up to that but that that is all in like including financing fees and everything like the total total project cost which includes like if if they like the acquisition cost and the renovation cost plus whatever the financing and everything that is required i see and okay so you can send over yeah i can i can share that analysis yeah which we which i did with emma and rachel were on the call so i pressure tested the assumptions with them around staffing and other things so i can i can share that with you okay and then do you know if they had equity to bring to a project they'll have to fundraise for that okay and what's the acquisition price on this church joy we put an l o i n for nine hundred thousand because that was actually market value but they're asking three point four okay yeah i know so waiting to hear back from the the broker called our broker and said hey you're crazy do you want to sharpen your pencil and our broker came back and said here are all the comps of all the churches commercial office everything that is sold in the last three years the highest is you know at whatever the square footage was which brings it to you know one point one i think was it and we went in at nine hundred and so we're waiting for that response back from reviewing all of our because he did he said well look if you go to the comps please send those to me that i missed so that was what we're waiting for the concert bring it to three point four million dollars so don't you all have you can you explain to me a little bit about this foundation structure so they had there's a foundation yeah no so so so there is a wildflower foundation which is a national organization now that foundation is basically similar to the kip foundation you you like that's the parallel so they don't run regions like regions are their own like how kip la or kip socal and others are there so wildflower schools of colorado is the entity that is operating schools here in other states where they so only in three states they are operating it as a charter in all other states it's more of a private school or or esa or other other options but only in three states dc minnesota and here are they they are operating as charters so so just for colorado like wildflower schools of colorado is the single entity that has both charters both aurora one and the grand junction one and that entity is that that entity has a single pnl like even though they have to report it like their internal philosophy is that they do a pnl by or budgeting by each center but it all rolls up into a single charter so so that is where like for that that was my question for them like which entity or like which unit should we underwrite is it like just this particular site or like your entire wildflower schools of colorado because that's the five hundred one c three who will be the borrower in in in this case so that is separate entity from the because you mentioned in other states they are yeah each state is a separate entity and then the foundation is basically another entity now the role of the foundation is basically the model providing professional development of teachers help in setting up a new region plus the wildflower has also received csp funding like for all charter schools for all all region charter schools so they have allocated certain csp to colorado charter schools so so they they basically are administering that and then the other role which also wildflower foundation plays is provide financing for upfront like construction which one of their sites in aurora took that financing but realized like their interest rate was even higher than what they were getting otherwise so so they're not borrowing on behalf of the school they're actually lending to the schools they are not borrow yeah foundation is not borrowing on behalf of the school that's lending to the to the to the regions yeah and i think i remember hearing their rate was around seven percent seven and a half yeah submit yeah wouldn't you model the two point four based on the two point four was based on a lower ppr but overall like blended rate of six and a half percent six and a half are you loading any money or any the funds that you've got so don't you go into the new ece one that the lady named lexi that i met with that she's putting in grand junction have you talked to kelly about that one so we basically have given a multi year grant to wildflower for their expansion so we basically like which which like full expansion to i think across both aurora and grand junction they have three hundred the charters approved for three hundred sixty or something students so we have given them full grants like but it's a multi year grant based on the milestones that they'll open these sites so once they have the leader or the teacher leader and the site identified we provide them the grant for the next site okay so we don't do loans it's it's only the grant that we have given them did i hear you say that so they have two charters one in aurora and one grand junction or they're operating under a single chart so there are two charters like two charters approved but but like it is more similar to like the lea is basically a single lea like in some states each charter is a separate lea like in california here like you can have overall lea and then multiple charters under that so that is how the structure is very flat schools of colorado is the lea that has two charters got it got it and this is a new school that has yet to start with students no they already have the grand junction school which it's in the same site that pre k through third during a church and they had the first right to expand to four through six okay this church has now filed it's not filed bankruptcy yet but they've got to sell the church because they're going under got it so they're offering that church site yeah that's blind site they're starting to get ready to open a second site they've got a new teacher leader she wants to do just the ecek one and then her kids would would go up to third grade but then they would funnel ended up four through sixth grade at the other grand junction site if that makes sense i just met with her on friday so so that's what i'm trying to yeah and then the aurora i have i've done three there and we have just one more we're doing expansion on one right now and then we'll do we'll add another in aurora but the most they can have with all of those is three hundred sixty eight something like that but then they're charters and so don't you just want to make sure we're aligned so it's given that csf is providing operating grants for growth this is i assume this is one that you would like us to consider for investment again if it fits your model like i mean hierarchies also we were providing but like want to make sure that it it fits your underwriting framework as well yeah yeah okay we'll have a look at it i'm just thinking like based on current size of how we size investments it wouldn't amount to much as we're only talking about you know less than three hundred thousand dollars be two hundred seventy five thousand for one hundred ten students but actually so sudansha if you could just send me the projections yeah i'll do that projections and the aquad yeah all right cool because i do think it's we're at the point now where they're asking enough questions that i think it's time for us to you know for crystal and i have a conversation i think once she's looked at the financials with the leadership of wildflower at least kelly their executive director i need to set up project man i need to start set up pmas with them knowing now what they want to do but also they're asking about financing okay okay anything else on wildflower where i move maybe not no it's just that like timeline wise joy like yeah still tbd right based on what church comes back with and if it is still within that okay yes so if the church comes back and they say we'll take the one million then we move forward and we'll literally have to jump on that because i want to close pretty quickly they have sold that three acres in the back to colorado housing resources so they're going to build on that three acres we got to do replading and that sort of thing but they're they're going to build some townhomes and things like ten or twelve townhomes got it and then scott just for context so for the other sites wildflower correct me if i'm wrong but other sites are mostly like this those are least space where wildflower has raised around like whatever they have financed around two hundred fifty k two hundred two hundred fifty k of financing to do the improvements some kind of improvements there so typically what i do is i have to keep my improvements anywhere between one hundred sixty and one hundred eighty yeah so depending on the size you know if it's the ece or you know if it's the one through three the fourth roof k because it build them out you know in chunks so i have to definitely keep it below two hundred but usually one hundred sixty to one hundred eighty is what i could keep it at and they've typically gone through jane yeah so they had we're going to go through jane with the last one meadow rue and there were some miscommunication things didn't happen so that's why they went with the foundation at seven percent or seven but maybe for seven and a half and maybe seven so yeah i i didn't see the loan disrupted their operating budget but so i don't know if meadow rue the second half that reach out to jane but so i said yeah so that's i'm trying to think i know they haven't reached out to for cactus bloom and i don't think they're going to reach out to jane for this other new one in she hasn't decided what flower she's going to be yet so let's see so yeah i know so all of wildflowers named after a flower every one of their schools so they're they could pick their flower so so yeah so she hasn't decided she's going to yes in the past scarlet like that is how they have like that's the size around one hundred eighty one hundred fifty to one hundred eighty k is what they have financed for leasehold improvements but this one this site would but like most of those sites have had like smaller enrollment overall this one is like more doing the whole pre k through six now and then pre k through eight once they get the charter approved amended sorry you fill the church up you know the sanctuary they've always got you know we already had to the drawings done with the you know with the you know based on the lace we were able to expand but now that they're selling it we're having to wait sit on it so they have a k eight model and they have an established ka model in aurora it sounds like and they operate that k eight on multiple sites yeah yeah so their model basically is that they do like an easy a lower elementary and upper elementary so that's their model because they want to keep it micro sites so in aurora they have like the one cluster which is pre k or like ece then ece as in like whatever early childhood to like kindergarten and then first to third and then three to five yeah that one and then and then they are doing like a another aurora replication for this but in grand junction because of the demographic and like how it is like they wanted to do it all at once side versus like three different sites for one tree one k through six which which is something that we have been telling them because from financial stability and then also from governance or one teacher leader to be the entrepreneur and accountable for academic outcomes that works better so we we feel like this at least one hundred ten is better than like thirty thirty thirty twenty kind of yeah okay so in aurora they're doing like a thirty thirty thirty yeah like again exactly yeah somewhere around that yeah yeah yeah yeah got it okay that's helpful thank you the model i'll send like it it has all the details of like how much is the capacity of each of the sites and those yeah okay okay let's see we're about halfway i was just gonna give you a heads up i've got a couple of new rules that i'm working on yeah i think we took this one last time we were together compass academy dps yeah looked at their numbers i think you know i've scheduled a call for crystal and i to meet with their executive director to go over her findings i think it may turn into just project management but i'll let you know yeah i know you had said that you guys have looked at yeah we we looked at compass we visited their site i think their academics are not there where we would be working with them so yeah yeah so and we're hoping to find out what the numbers are going to be you know break it south from last year i think we had last year's numbers but yeah so they they definitely have the money and they do want to find something that they can grow dps cut them down again three more classrooms so their enrollment has continued to leak on down because dps keeps taking more and more space away from them at that high school can i ask george i don't know if you know how how that allocation works but is is the loss of space a result of declining enrollment or is it that dps has taken the class from away and therefore they're losing enrollment yeah the latter yeah so dps has they're part of a high school so because they're a middle school and they got put in the bottom level of the high school so the high school continues to grow and so every year they take like two classrooms two classrooms and this year they took three so they had to actually tell some students they had to go to their home it's an alternative middle school they actually told some of the students they had to go back to their home home middle schools they and sorry just trying to reconcile how that there is no obligation from the district side to accommodate the current enrollment they can just produce the classrooms and they have to reduce their enrollment yes that's what i'm hearing from their executive director so good crystal and i are gonna kind of get to the bottom of it we have a meeting with him and the idea here they're trying to get off that campus i'm assuming yes yes stay in the same southwest area because they need to be close to the buses and the train station and that sort of thing obviously because that's where majority of their students are coming from so they've asked if i would help them try to find a location in that area and maybe do a long term lease because they were looking at purchasing i think what was it two or three million dollars they had him on hand or something so but i'm gonna let crystal have that conversation i'll be on the call and if we can help them financially great if not they definitely need project management so i'll just one quick second so yeah just aligned on what joy shared like their enrollment has come down and is now at two hundred students overall and then looking at their academic performance is why we kind of like this is their district so like it was single digit proficiency so that's why we we have not engaged with them so far yeah andre said there's an alternative school yeah middle school yeah and it took demographic to serve yeah and chris will take early on already because of academic performance is that we would be unlikely to invest in this or we could do project management yeah i think though i'd like for her to hear the story you know and we could definitely source financing we just may not be able to give financing ourselves right so i've heard brandon to feel like he's heard because he was the one that was bounced around on to everybody and he finally found me and he was like finally somebody that can like tell me what i need to do and so what i want to do is have him feel like he's been heard and then if we can't help him financially that's fine but maybe we can source financing we definitely could do project management but i do think it's along our definitely along our mission of helping the students yeah yeah enjoy when you connect with crypto i'm sure she'll go over but sooner that's sagashi notice that the academics will be a barrier even for sourcing financing from a number of our partners and cdfi the chief financing like they're all going to have pause at that and so just to be aware that even that will be it's not easy thing to secure so what i'm hoping is and i've been looking with a real estate agent i'm hoping there are some buildings in that area that are a little run down but i'm hoping if maybe we can do a long term lease we can use some of those funds to do tenant improvements to be able to use it as a school so i'm hoping and then at that point they wouldn't have to source any financing right so i don't know i'm just i just i'm just trying to find a way to help them out and even if we're no but even if we're just working with him taking through the process so that he gets smart on kind of how all that works and can can know how to better position school even in the future i think it's it's worthwhile that's part that's part of the mission as well so yes certainly worth the time and then the other one real quick because i want to get to years montrose classical so that you know i've been in touch with them really since you guys put me in touch with them they came back that the board i think you know the state board of education senate backed the mantra okay so they that they voted to approve their charter with conditions i don't know if you talked to don or not so you're shaking your head so maybe you already know all this so don and i've been in conversation and so i am going to be scheduling a meeting with donna and hopefully crystal i've got to get some dates back at times to meet so they want to hire us for our services and i don't know if it's going to be they reach out to jane and this is another i've got i'm having coffee with jane next week because i just don't understand based on all the conversations we've had they were they were told by jane that they're not loaning out money anymore but yet i thought on that call we had the jane they were learning money just short term yeah but like this is also very small size loans it won't be for construction like they only have one million dollars left from daniel's fund so so they are only doing those line of credit against csp kind of like two years right yeah that was the line of credit not the construction loan so they are not doing any any more construction yeah okay they don't have like they i think they only have left nine hundred k or or a million up to a million that was a grant from daniels not the pri okay they got one point one as a csp approved montrose did again according to donna so i put her in touch with and thanks for the when i was it you or was it peter somebody introduced me to marco so i went and had breakfast with margot last week she's a senior vice president alpine you know who's handling all of those the daniel fund so i'll put them in touch with her as well she said that she spoke to the league yesterday she has indana and that the lady said everything's on hold because of the shutdown so she was going to reach out and talk to margo no funds are being moved given reimbursed nothing so but anyway so that's another one that i don't know if we'll do financing i do want to hear her story and then talk to them a little bit more they've got a church and an office building that they're looking at right now obviously the office building would need more ti than the church so yeah so i can i can give you a little bit more context on the school and like our conversations with them so far so montrose classical i think like this has been like a more of a community initiative like their families have come together and they want the classical model in montrose again it has been a long fight for them to get denied by district go to state appeal and then get approved there so they have done like a lot of work with them like for us like the biggest question for them was the student population that they're going to serve while there is an intent to serve high like more diverse student population their enrollment policy or like some of the things that we have discussed with them it's not clear of like how they are going to do that again knowing the location knowing how they are going about it like this might be the option where like more affluent families sign up for the school and like it resonates with them especially because it's also a classical model and like so far the effort has been from the families that are more affluent while so so that is where we are we have left with them and the second thing is that they have not identified the school leader yet like who's going to be the academic vision holder or school person who will run the school so two things where we are like working with them on one is who's the school leader because the student demographics that they serve in the long term like will also be tied to like what's the vision of that leader and how much effort they are putting to make this school more diverse and then the second thing is like yeah just figuring out how this yeah how the enrollment for their founding year because they're still looking to launch next year so how how that holds up so right now we haven't finalized if we are doing a grant or a full diligence with them unless they have like without leader like we have never done a diligence or approved a grant so so that would be that would be like i think the main holding point for us till they identify the leader and then the demographics yeah so donna who's the president of school board yeah she said that she wants to meet either thursday or friday they said they have two hundred sixteen letters of intent for her families yeah and i would be meeting with her in the new principal so i shouldn't say it the leader was a principal is it alyssa is it alisa or somebody or is that another leader no there's another person who's working on who worked with them to get through the charter and everything at least like last week from what i heard from lydia's conversations from last friday i don't think they have hired like a school principal maybe somebody else on the board yeah alyssa is the person who we have been engaging with as she ran the whole campaign got parents together and did the state board of what's her name alyssa yes yes yeah okay so if you're meeting her like again she's great and if she becomes the school leader that would even be better because she's she's most aligned on in terms of student demographics she would like the school to serve okay but i like at least till last week she had not finalized if she will be the school leader okay now do you have any documentation because i did tell her that if we were going to meet with crystal that i was going to need to see financials she said she had every bit of that like five year financials five year enrollment analysis she said she had anything i needed she said she could send to me do you no i i don't have no it's probably the work that they did for their charter application so might be worth looking at it yeah good sorry joy so on friday i thought they didn't have the charger so in the last couple of days they did get a charter approved yeah there is verbally approved at the twenty third board meeting and it's approved with conditions like a traffic study so that's why donna called me she was like i need you to help me and she said you know if i need to hire you how does that work with blueprint so scarlett charter is approved the leader is not hired right the leader's not hired okay yeah we were talking on friday the charter was not approved either okay also the charter is basically they sent it back to the district to approve like state said that yeah this should be approved the sent it back to the district district is basically just playing ball in finalizing the contract so those bunch of conditions yeah because they don't want a charter school yeah so they've added they're making it difficult yeah to make it difficult classical's first school right this is a brand new school yeah all right so whatever i find out on that donkey or whatever information i get from donna or elise or alyssa whatever the name is i'll just share it with you yeah and then yeah once we have more conversations around the school leader and others i'll keep you posted based on what we discussed okay okay okay that's what i had what do you have for me so the one that i have this was the conversation i had yesterday grove elementary which is bal swan has surfaced she reached out to me yeah so that has surfaced again and i told her yesterday of like so i think that the new update or a good update is basically like they are not planning this project like with the whole bal swan umbrella like this is a this is a separate charter because when they got denied last year one of the feedback from boulder valley district was that hey there is this non profit and there is this public school funding this public non public intermingling of funds they were not clear about the governance structure so what they basically have done is have like a more independent charter with a licensing agreement with balswan so there will be more like the model sharing the professional development but like no significant and then their foundation might also help them with the fundraising stuff but not like an official part of the same five hundred one c three entity that they were initially envisioning so this charter will be filed separately now now they basically are figuring out this three dimensional chess of the district to apply for this charter where the facilities available and where there is growing enrollment again enrollment is not as big of a challenge for them because of the student population they are targeting i think for them the more thing they basically are trying to figure out the facility option so they they they now are not tied to like just bvsd they are looking at westminster which is only like eight minute drive from there less than my they are looking at adams twelve and they are also looking at jeffco they have looked at some of the some of the facilities through the broker again they haven't they don't have an exclusive contract but they were looking at certain properties and they said that like all these all these church or like these temporary spaces are requiring some kind of renovation so they were trying to understand of like even if it's a temporary or a long term lease like what are the options do they do they have if they are not going with the grounds up build like what kind of temporary facilities that they can get into so what i shared with them they're looking forward like a thirty fifty thousand i mean like a normal kindergarten i mean an elementary school yeah like a normal elementary school and i think their their charter would be around two hundred fifty to three hundred students is what three hundred yeah maximum of up to three hundred students but again like yeah so so now like at least based on this new like this charter school board that they have the discussions that they have had they are more aligned on like yeah it has to be an independent space not part of this whole twenty thirty million dollar project we know like we have to be in like a affordable facility they also are have gotten a round of like grounds up build is not possible but now what are the options that they have is something that they need help trying to figure out and then also like she reached out to me on my old company email oh okay probably responded to her from blueprint she was like oh let me get some more information i'll check back in with you and i haven't heard back from her so yeah yeah yeah so i think like i think initially like it it would be again they don't have the charter approved yet but like for the charter they need to show like these are the two three options or this is the strategy that they'll go after and then depending on the facility they would like to have they would like to figure out which which district to apply to okay do you want me to reach back out to her do you want to i know there's not an e introduction needed but do you want to somehow connect us again yeah because i had the conversation yesterday i'll just like send like yeah a reintroduction there because you know westminster i got a call from you know we're we're buying the aak building from cec right so mark who's executive director over at cec for the facilities they're getting ready to sell that high school in westminster oh okay yeah they're getting rid of it so that might be an option for them but i think it's probably it's going to be probably way too big for an elementary school it's a it's a high school right now but but it's owned by cec yeah oh okay yes they're high school up there so i was supposed to go tour it probably sometime i want to go tour before i had to drive up to boulder i mean to westminster in the snow okay and then the last one is more of a brainstorming so i'll need more brain power here is figuring out dsst so yeah i met with them you met with nick okay yeah nick and jacob i went to a women's thing whatever over a glass of wine nella was like i need to hire you and i was like oh okay so i don't know if there's the line talking or she actually liked what i was telling her about you know what brent does but anyway the next day i get an email from nick and jacob and i went and spent about an hour with them just chit chatting about blueprint what blueprint does i didn't do like a full formal whatever because that was not like a i think it was more of a nail it wants us to meet you so we're going to meet you but then once i got in there they were like oh and realized you know that i knew what i was talking about jacob and i talked a lot about facilities cost of facilities i sent them a couple of things via email and just to hear back from them but they did also go meet with the developer and i don't know how that meeting went for some land out there in aurora out close to not at the airport but out that way painted prairie i think painting yeah painted something denver school of science and technology so they are the biggest network here in colorado so let me give you like a little more context and like where i need i would love to work yeah because that is that i guess is door to more like working with the network so dsst they have i think sixteen schools here in denver and two schools in aurora right now it's the highest performing sixth through twelve in the entire state i think twelve of their sixteen schools were like blue ribbon or like what whatever the count is so very high performing school grew very grew very pretty quickly in seventeen eighteen twenty seventeen eighteen time when denver was like more progressive and like wanted to have this portfolio approach so they basically have six through twelve schools so they run like middle school and then they started as a high school but now have like a six through twelve pipeline very strong financial position primarily because all their schools in denver were all district facilities and those district facilities were also like pretty big like soccer field and football field and others so and then they went to aurora in twenty twenty two so aurora basically had a partnership with them where they included them in the bond and then dsst and aurora's public schools foundation did a joint fundraising to have another thousand student six through twelve campus so that is the ast one project so lot of philanthropic organizations foundations here came together made that happen but and then they've got approved by aurora for two schools so this was one six through twelve and then another six through twelve campus but the second six route twelve campus it delay it has delayed twice already and now finally opening in twenty twenty eight because the board changed the superintendent changed everybody changed so now like and then even dsst there was a leadership change nella came from yes prep and she took over so the second school now finally got approved they have included them in their cop and like our aps board has also approved so they will be locating with another high school that is coming up for aps so they are going with the second school also but the total project budget for this school excluding all the shared space that they will have all the soccer field and everything is fifty five million dollars forty five fifty to fifty five million dollars so fifty eight yeah so fifty fifty eight probably yeah crazy yeah so the deal is basically they are going for cop with aurora which will raise around forty forty five million dollars and they are jointly raising twelve million dollars to make this work as a fundraising piece again this is a separate project not through this the reason i was giving this context is that here we are dealing with the curse of prior expectations which is we are used to these forty fifty sixty million dollar buildings what do we do now now and that is where nick has been with the organization for so long i think he is still in that mental block of like how does it work on a lower budget or like how do we do this yeah how do we make it work kind of like if and then so but nela who is the new ceo she comes from yesterday from texas context she wants to run quickly like how texas is used to and yes prep has grown over time she has her expectations that she is like building is not my program i am very flexible it is just the internal team and change management that she has to manage so now this painted query like this is the third aurora campus that has come up the developer really wants them there and dsst also wants to expand to full k through twelve instead of just six through twelve so this would be their first k through twelve campus they have never designed an elementary school before like all their schools both either district buildings or these new constructions have been through yeah have been basically like grounds of construction so they are open to do that but like they need to figure out like what is the path to that how much it is going to cost we are ready to adjust our design elementaries the new area for us we will ready to do that but right now they don't know how to do that and then nick also has this block of like how can it be done without spending fifty five million dollars lidan and i were brainstorming is one we have examples from idaho where folks are doing rounds of build gem prep has done k through twelve pre k through twelve and their buildings are costing somewhere around twenty to twenty two million dollars and then with developer partnership developer is basically donating the land and all the site improvements so around four to five million dollars three to four million dollars are getting reduced there so school is only financing seventeen eighteen million dollars total currently so which works out for them around fifteen percent of the ppr so those were one examples that i am planning to share with them but i am pretty sure you all might have like many more examples from california texas others were like even if it s a grounds up build and you want to have certain standards fifty five million dollars price tag is something i'm finding it difficult to wrap my head around so i think part of it is urgency around like this developer conversation has opened up now and they want to figure out how to have a k eight or k through twelve there but it has to be more aurora doesn t have capacity unless they go for a new bond next to do this so they are trying to figure out like if dsst has to do it on its own how would that work and then what is the design what is the budget that they can get to so they always start with the building and this fifty five million dollars we have to figure out for them or with them is that what is the realistic number that they can still get to without taking out all the bells and whistles soccer field so this was for expansion to a third campus near aurora yeah it is a new development yeah private site or would it be the districts of inviting land for it most probably the developer will providing the land for you thirteen acres and the developer they are building so many homes they would donate the land donate the land yeah with lisa at a very low for dsst before so they have done with oakwood homes with awkward homes in green valley ranch they have done this model before where developer because they are such high performing schools developer has an incentive to bring them in so that they can sell more homes right but certainly it is land is near free we'll say yeah the land acquisition does not need to be accounted for as part of the budget right now the other thing we talked about sadanche we talked about the one with the painted prairie developer out there but we also talked about a possible k five or k eight for about one thousand two hundred students with that with this k twelve yeah i think it s that the same it s the same one they wouldn t build just in elementary they just do the whole k twelve ideally yes yeah ideally ok yeah because he talked to me about if they look at a k pop or a k eight if we talk about different land we talked about lotus for one thousand two hundred students around seventy thousand square feet but i talked to them the morning and that afternoon is when they all met with painted prairie so you've probably talked to them since they had the meeting with painted yeah yeah i think that conversation they were like yeah this conversation has opened up again like how do we figure out if dsst has to go by its own without any district bond support is that right no that was going to be for the k eight what sfk twelve total i don't know what the k what would the k twelve bed so they typically have around five hundred students in six through eight and then around another five hundred in nine through twelve and then k through five i think they are counting seven hundred so if they re only doing k through eight then it will be one thousand two hundred and if it s k sorry k through eight it will be one two hundred and if it s k through twelve like yeah around seventeen ok and then joy you said that seventy thousand was for the possibly k pop or a k eight because twelve n yeah but a lot of that was just well we're meeting with the developer this afternoon we ll get back with you so it sounds like they did meet with the developer and decided on k twelve it might be k eight joy i think this is just again design phase or iteration phase so they might only think of k eight right now and do nine through twelve later maybe second third phase thirteen acres out there if they needed to and the developer is just providing the land or is the intention that the developer also has a team that s going to be doing the design construction all of that is it a package deal or are they free to develop however and with whoever they want on the land or is it my understanding is like that is to be negotiated if there s incentive and cost benefit for developer to do that we can propose that that is something that we can propose as a design of what we want and siranche you mentioned so there s this prayer there s this potential for this donated land from a developer and denver wants them to expand to throw to k twelve no so denver denver doesn t want them to grow nella wants to expand but in dps like getting a new charter approved is close to impossible so that s why and our advice to them was also like hey you are going into elementary for the first time don t do it as a turnaround because that s two x three x more harder than starting afresh so that s why they are prioritizing this k eight first get the model right for elementary school and then approach dps of like you have tens of low performing schools i think she ll give you a proof they bring enough money into dps yeah they can but i think for her it s getting the model right before they do that we did talk about that yeah and then she does want to go look at k eight s and things like that so with these sixteen schools i mean so yeah i'm just curious if they have been primarily operating on district land it sounds like they are having some bond issuances so they have borrowed money from the bottom so most of these schools are district facilities some of these are by them but like district has put in bond money or basically have bought and then leased it back to dsst so those are the things aurora like so the thing with this third school is aurora doesn t have capacity in their current bond to go after this school developer is basically like if i wait for aurora to pass the bond and like build this it will take them another five seven years they want to sell start selling the homes as soon as possible so they want to partner with dssd so they have an incentive to bring dssd in and that s why they are donating the land sst in your portfolio now they haven t opened a new school in last three years but we already pretty much have done the diligence for this second aurora school it s just that the facilities got finalized very recently and it will open in twenty twenty eight so we are not like it three years out right now so next spring is when we will basically provide them the grant for that school but if this third school happens sooner than that we pretty much are ready with our diligence to approve and then they are also part of csgf portfolio right ok and this school is not part of the growth plan so they will be fresh grant funding from charter school growth fund also once if this gets rolling ok so you are not sure if they have the right status in the csgf portfolio to qualify for the dell capitalist fund no they can qualify but they can qualify but then also not going with a fifty five million dollar quid it should be affordable so that criteria for the csgf yeah that's good to know in terms of sourcing financing for like a twenty million dollars project yeah no definitely i think they will looking at their financial health the fundraising that they'll bring into this and then the rest of it through financing i think we'll have to put the capital stack but right now i think the biggest thing that they have to figure out is that how to get it done in more reasonable like what should be the design how should we get it done incidentally there's you know there's a couple ways to approach that i think one of the ones we'll be going starting from affordability so what does it look like given their anticipated enrollment and all of that projections how much could they support when they don't have denver support and then that could drive ok well what type of budget are we talking about and that's not sufficient ok what type of fundraising are you looking at doing in addition to your school budgets yeah so i think that part is fine but i think where they are stuck is actually getting like ok they come up with a number let's say they can afford twenty five thirty million dollars let's say but their experience is like oh this can only be built for fifty million dollars and that's why they are stuck like i think what we need to or what we need to work with them on is that if they can afford thirty million how to get the design and build yeah how can we what design works for that and like how does that align with their model is where we need to work with them so we already have the target number then so target number i think we can quickly pull because they did that for their aurora campus anyway so we can we can get that number quickly and then we can also have like a plug for the fundraising stuff which again not worried about dsst and fundraising they have done twelve million for every building so very well respected yeah cml yeah so when i talk to eric and jacob they wanted me to set up some schools for them to go tour is that what you're hearing as well yeah that was again like lydia's suggestion to neila is that because neila is convinced she has worked at yes perhaps she knows how to get this done and this can happen yes prep has done that it's like the old guard the team that she needs to convince that this can be done so that's why she's like they were very surprised lotus for they were like is that just like paint on the walls and i'm like exactly right so that is the mindset that they are coming with so lydia basically told nella is like ask them to visit few schools and look at the design and like see that because they have not seen projects being done in thirty million dollars so yeah okay do you want me to follow back up with eric or is that a conversation look me in on think i think what would be helpful is you and i have a conversation with sit with nick share the examples of like what we have and then also like because right even sharing the examples won't convince because he'll be like oh those buildings are not per standards of dsst so we'll have to like figure out like what schools because that's why i was thinking of like going to idaho with nick but because of some of the traveling schedule it's not working out in the near term i do want to have a conversation with you about idaho too so at some point not today obviously maybe yeah because some i also need to figure out how did they get the two percent financing done in idaho recently i'm guessing it's usda but i don't know you know that's how atlas they got usda financing yeah yeah so yeah i think next steps on that joy let's you and i meet with nick my guess is that like this will require us to like work with the design firm or design architect firm to kind of create a plan with them and do the costing or make it with him whatever is the number for twelve hundred students it works out okay so are you thinking like i have some examples you know i've obviously have k twelve k eight that i've built from the ground up here in colorado i mean over the years would that be beneficial are these district if these are district buildings then i'm i don't know what their budget was and more recent i think like more like more charter examples which were done within okay that i think are the are the ones we need to but again like those examples would just be the starter like k eight shorter i haven't done a k twelve chart it'll be k twelve that i did was when i was douglas county school district we bought we built three of those and then the part two of that is more critical joy like is is there a design firm that we can work with to create initial designs and do the cost estimate without land if we have to do the cost estimate what what is that okay yeah i've got a couple of that i actually built the buildings at douglas county that i was really impressed with their their work so and i've used them since with charter schools so yeah so i guess like let's do that like let's let's meet with nick propose this strategy of like working with the design firm to get to the get to like what would it cost because another piece of it is also like when when they are going through the district and district is building all these fillings like they have to follow the prevailing wage and other things like that also increases the cost with twenty twenty five percent at least so that is also like another thing where we'll cut down the cost like if we go around that so we'll have to figure out like how to what's the cost of gate if we have to do it yeah i had asked them to send me the design they said it was a book the design book for dps for building schools yeah but yeah that's what we are that's what we have to push them on is like we are not going by dps design standards yeah that's what they were saying why it costs so much is because they had to follow the book of standards yeah because it was district building yes but now we have to get out yeah like if we come out of that and if we do it more grounds up and get rid of prevailing wage and like some of these design requirements like what would it cost so it's really just about helping them understand like private facilities can be done and they are often they are most often done with like half of what you've been doing with district facilities and here's what a twenty million dollars building could look like yeah because it may also be some expectation setting as well yes yes i think that change management soccer fields and gymnasium and stuff like that that may not be possible without submit for fundraisers but how do you build a project that accounts for that stuff that might happen later on right let's enter your building let's get you your core stuff and if you need a few years to fundraise to come back and add a gym to come back and add a field like how do we how do we plan an account for that in the conversations with the developer yeah like lotus is a good example i mean we're not going to be done with that for several months but right like school owned a site they have some play fields doing some new construction and so you can speak to sort of base development and different play in front of they go colorado examples i mean you can go to the blueprint website and look through like all of our projects see pictures of the types of schools that we've built number of classrooms square footage and get that book so started why i said like it was curse of prior expectation was also like what families were looking for is that if they open a new school five miles from their existing schools families would be like hey this building is very different like you don't offer soccer or whatever program here like why should i say but like now the window has opened up because they are doing elementary for the first time yeah so like for them also like how they position and market might change so this is a good option and while i'm stressing like while we are talking about a specific painted peri project like our bet on them and what we have shared or what neila has shared about the strategic vision she's working with her board on it's at least three schools in next five years elementary schools so and like looking at the authorization landscape if anyone can do it it could be it can only be dssd at that scale that's why like putting more time in like figuring out the design for this so that it can become the blueprint for their growth is is something that lydia and i are kind of trying to figure out how to get them comfortable with with this model yeah yeah you know saddam's in town next week would it be eric eric wanted to follow up should i follow up and see if maybe that's a time for at least john to do a handshake or should we wait a little bit either way like if either way i don't my guess is like yeah relationship building never hurts so if that works out it's fine but again like i don't want to assume anything right you know yeah yeah okay okay your face said it all no but also i'm i'm just trying to figure out like is there another purpose right for this meeting i was not sure that's why but again like super aligned with nella on this she is there we did a full session with their whole c team on this and after the meeting when the rest of their c team left nella was like i want to make it happen like help me figure out how to get around this expectation setting you know it's not a bad idea if john's got time on his calendar because because of all of john's experience and all of our other reasons right they specifically said sort of the blueprint methodology when we're being creative and hunting down sites and trying to figure out how to make things work so i think if he has to yeah alan dar it's not a bad idea to set that up just again to build relationships so sadanche you and i talk about that with you know and run it past lydia says i know john was coming out to see lydia but if lydia's not going to be available he was not going to come out so i just need to make sure that if we're going to set something up it's you know using his time wise what i keep is going to fly out here yeah i think fifteenth is the only one i'm on road i'll be in fort collins most of the day but fourteenth or sixteenth works well yeah but lydia but i know lydia can sing in the text saying she may not be available at all next week so if that's what he was thinking about maybe not coming out next week so ok so i guess if he's not coming out now we can do bit of groundwork with nick and then kind of wherever john is here next like we can set that timer out there i'd rather you have that groundwork put together so when he comes out it's going to be a really good conversation what do you think yeah i think i think that makes sense because i still see like there are one or two steps with nick to like move forward with that because even like for him to be like yeah let's let's go and see more schools like i'm like let's do like little bit at least one conversation with him yeah a little bit yeah he had a lot of questions but jacob and i really connected you know just because i think he's overseeing all the construction and that sort of thing so he had a lot more detailed questions than eric did i don't know if you've met jacob yet or not that's their director facilities or i can't remember what his title was okay so okay so i'm not gonna respond i'm not gonna follow no i i i will loop you in in my email to nick and we will we can have we can find time so that's one and then scarlett i'll share the wildflower model with you was there anything else and then yeah joy i will do the follow up with header at grove elementary and then loop you in so that you can follow up with so now who's at grover grove is the balswan balswan spin out yeah deb was the one who reached out yeah so debbie basically like that's what the separation that they did was that they're going for this charter independently they're board and they have hired a new leader to lead that debbie's is only looking at the ball zone for now okay good okay okay wow accomplished a lot sorry we stayed over a little bit but it's good information yeah no i i mean i really appreciate the dsst brainstorming i think that could be a big one if we are able to to like get them over the line yeah yeah appreciate it cool okay so clear next steps i will follow up then and i'll let you know where to find out on the montrose call yeah yeah that was the other one but yeah i'll i'll also see like if we follow up with them based on school leader hiring a pajama or elisa anisa yeah alyssa yeah okay i just know donna donna's just the one that keeps calling me so oh okay do you want to be looked in on that you mean just send you an invite just in case no not yet because we haven't engaged with them on the grant yet like i think for us like the two gating questions on leader and student demographics based on that we'll figure out how much to lean in you tell me it would be like over fifty percent because there's a is there an industry a town that's not very far from montrose that has what is it like a plant or something and that's so the demographics there hispanics is very high and so i don't know if she was telling you about that or not so i'll get all the information and send you my notes sounds good awesome all right anything else scarlett you got anything no that's a lot it's a lot perfect your grilling this is exciting to me though yeah the dsst is interesting to me you know i'm trying to help them problem solve something especially just having a more established cmo that probably has a stronger you know balance sheet would be good to add to the portfolio all right okay you guys have a good good evening now for us it's four thirty here we have a couple hours left yes all right thank you bye",

          "content": "pretty good so far just starting catching up i was traveling last couple of days for work so just catching up on all my missed emails well pleasure to meet you to find out a little bit more about what you guys are doing and let you know what you'd like to know about us yeah sure so peter gave in that email exchange i got little context but would love to learn more about the school and the overall capital need that you all have the facilities but before that i can just quickly share brief introduction about myself and colorado schools fund what we do and how we support schools so that might give you the context in terms of and would love to learn more about legacy classical as well so i'm sudanshu i work for colorado schools fund lydia hoffman who's the ceo and i launched this fund last year so we are like little one and a half year into this but prior to that we both were working with charter school growth fund which works nationally and supports charter schools so the schools that we worked with and like our goal is to support charter school of charter schools now in colorado but the schools that we worked with like there are three main areas that we focus on one is schools that serve historically underserved students so the schools that we have worked so far with have like slightly higher free and reduced student lunch population or students of color or students with special needs like those are the schools that we typically work with and then the second is just the school quality piece so we kind of like geek out a lot on the data and understand like the whole academic story and like how they are serving the students and then the last one is more around the community need we support schools that provide school options and solve the community needs so coming from coming from the district versus like schools or like networks coming out of state and launching without understanding the need of the real community so i think that those three are like the biggest drivers for us on the type of schools we work with how we support schools are like there are multiple levels how we support but the biggest one is like for schools that are launching new schools or like for leaders who are launching new schools or schools that are expanding and adding anywhere between one hundred fifty to two hundred seats or more we provide startup or expansion grants to them so that is that is one part of it but outside of that also like we work with the network of consultants and experts who we have worked for like past ten plus years at the growth fund who provide like direct specific supports to schools like so for example if the school requires support around facilities or financing we work with them to kind of figure out like how we can support them if it's enrollment if it's academic improvement all the other areas like if the schools are part of our grand portfolio we provide all these additional supports to them as well so that's like a very quick high level of like our work but yeah would love to learn more about legacy and how you're yeah just just about the school and like how i can be helpful yeah what we legacy has started on an expansion campaign they will help us grow from around four hundred to a little over six hundred students okay we've done some pre design and pre pricing and things like that and so we're working with the us department of agriculture right now because elizabeth is kind of a semi rural area so we we think there's a chance we'll get some funding through the usda but we're also responsible for you know finding a percentage of the cost of the expansion doing kind of on our own so we have some assets that we have built up over the years in reserves but we're also looking for some startup grant type assistance you know obviously not asking for someone to fund the full twenty million that were that we need to expand our building but we that's kind of what we're looking for we do have high academic performance our our spf last year was in the mid seventies penn state of colorado so we are a pretty high performing school we don't tend to have a lot of free and reduced lunch and it's even lower the last couple years because people stop filling it out because they didn't need to fill it out to get free lunch that's true yeah that's the trend we are also seeing yeah back and forth but yeah and so we're that's a little bit about us you know as you were talking through some of the priorities that you guys usually look for we probably would not qualify under you know from a socioeconomic standpoint you know we have some racial diversity in our school but it's you know it's it's who lives in our community and it's pretty highly caucasian if that's a disqualifier well that you know we i don't know what what you think about that if if that's kind of one of your priorities i'm not sure we would meet that right so again like the way we look at the the high need student population it's not like just that's why i give like if i when when i was working in california new york like those regions like it was it was clear because there was a high overlap between unfortunately there was a high overlap between like students of color or free and reduced lunches like students eligible for free and reduced lunch i think in colorado one of the things that we are also learning is that like the the way the student demographics are in different districts like it's it so again there's no like there has to be a certain free and reduced lunch student population or there has to be a certain students of color we try to define it like in in respect to the district that or the student population that they're serving with respect to the state so overall like i think that still like i was looking at some of the numbers so you said like you are at six hundred students oh sorry six hundred students now and then looking to grow to eight hundred but then at around four hundred okay this this year we opened up some additional classes to kind of squeezing in available space but the extra really will take us from around four hundred to over six hundred got it and two hundred student increase got it legacy academy right like that's the official name yes legacy academy is the official name and there's a i think there's a legacy high school somewhere north part of denver that's that's not us okay legacy academy so the enrollment it was showing around five hundred fifty three last year k through eight odd that is that's including we have a home school support program oh got it got it those students count like half ppr got it thank you you're in a different building so that's probably why that number is a little different oh okay okay and then it shows around seventeen percent three hundred use lunch last year and yeah to your point like it has gone down because not there's no incentive to actually fill the form out so definitely like that's not the that's the trend we are seeing across and then looking at the other so merlin i think like one of the biggest things that again from the growth standpoint you are adding two hundred seats like that fits into like the schools that we are working with and how we provide the operating general operating grant to them and then it's on the schools if they want to use it for a facilities or they want to use it for specific like operating need but i think like from the student demographics perspective is where like i think it might it it will not fit where we like how our focus is because again like with limited philanthropy we're prioritizing and that's how what we have named for our board and for ourselves of like the schools that we want to work with so yeah i guess like that is the biggest thing but otherwise also like have you already identified the the team or like who the financing sources like who how you would be financing and the project management team for the construction yes we have owners rep that we've hired to do this and our architects about halfway through the projects he's got at least a mapinational design so we can get some price estimates for the construction okay so we we do have that in place okay got it yeah because i was thinking of like if there are other finance like other low cost financing sources you said usda might be one yeah because we're in a we're in albert county which qualifies us as a rural area the united states department of agriculture has a program they call community facilities fund yeah and we working with them for over a year and a half to get the funding that we need for for most of this yeah we do need to put in some of the funds ourselves so they'll fund about eighty to ninety percent of it got it so you said the project budget is around twenty million dollars and you're looking and let's say eighty percent eighty to eighty five percent comes from that so you're still so you have to internally raise somewhere around three million dollars yes okay and most of that we have just in reserves we built up the schools twenty some years old so we've we've got some nice reserves we just are looking for some grants it's part of what the usd like usda likes us to do is to talk to different possible other sources of funding to contribute to that and we've gotten a small donation and we have because a few you know few buckets of money that we have probably try to pay off that we have on our current building in the same process and that'll free up some cash and from the reserves on that so we've looked at a variety of ways to to kind of help offset that got it and like what's the current gap like if you're account for all different sources and users like is there still like i don't think we really have a gap okay but it would to do to use all of our own cash that would delete our reserves which yeah yeah good position long term but yeah we're advantage it like we are but we'd love to get some expansion help as well so got it are you all also like because you're expanding by two hundred students are you also thinking of like applying for the csp grant for the league yes okay yeah okay so yeah i think that we thought about applying in the first round but we really are financing them kind of just i mean working with federal agencies can be a really slow process that's true and so we push back so we'll apply in this next round okay okay yeah because you're still like in the process i think you should you all should still qualify so i think that could be one of the sources too not directly contribute towards facilities but can like you can utilize some of those funds you know things like furniture right right anything that doesn't attach to the building yeah yeah so that that could be another source yeah well unfortunately like looking at the student demographics and like what you shared that doesn't directly fit how we like the schools that we support but again like was trying to brainstorm like are there other opportunities that i know of where again like similar to daniel's fund like they have specific focus like we kind of focused on like the the schools that we are working on let me let me change track just a little bit sure i'm kind of semi retired and i work for legacy as a consultant a couple days a week one of the other things i'm working on is to do some new school startups okay and i what i'd like to do is send you an email with links to our that startup group's website because we would be starting and we'd like to start a school in pueblo we'd like to start a school in district eleven in colorado springs my son is up in fort collins and he would like to start at the school up there and so we do have some projects that we're working on that just like to at least send you our website tell you a little bit about what we're doing and you can kind of review that and maybe we could talk again in a few weeks yeah no that that would be interesting because for what you guys are working for okay yeah no that that would be good and and the geographies that you named like d eleven pueblo fort collins like at least in d eleven and pueblo we have already supported few startup schools there or expansion schools there because again it kind of ties to the the schools that we are looking to work with so like if yeah if there are new schools that you are looking or like you are working with to launch in these geographies would love to connect and learn more about about them as well yeah well also i'll send you a little more info about that and then maybe we can talk again in a few weeks yeah for sure yeah good luck to do that all right thank you yeah appreciate it thanks",

provide startup or expansion grants to them so that is that is one part of it but outside of that also like we work with the network of consultants and experts who we have worked for like past ten plus years at the growth fund who provide like direct specific supports to schools like so for example if the school requires support around facilities or financing we work with them to kind of figure out like how we can support them if it's enrollment if it's academic improvement all the other areas like if the schools are part of our grand portfolio we provide all these additional supports to them as well so that's like a very quick high level of like our work but yeah would love to learn more about legacy and how you're yeah just just about the school and like how i can be helpful yeah what we legacy has started on an expansion campaign they will help us grow from around four hundred to a little over six hundred students okay we've done some pre design and pre pricing and things like that and so we're working with the us department of agriculture right now because elizabeth is kind of a semi rural area so we we think there's a chance we'll get some funding through the usda but we're also responsible for you know finding a percentage of the cost of the expansion doing kind of on our own so we have some assets that we have built up over the years in reserves but we're also looking for some startup grant type assistance you know obviously not asking for someone to fund the full twenty million that were that we need to expand our building but we that's kind of what we're looking for we do have high academic performance our our spf last year was in the mid seventies penn state of colorado so we are a pretty high performing school we don't tend to have a lot of free and reduced lunch and it's even lower the last couple years because people stop filling it out because they didn't need to fill it out to get free lunch that's true yeah that's the trend we are also seeing yeah back and forth but yeah and so we're that's a little bit about us you know as you were talking through some of the priorities that you guys usually look for we probably would not qualify under you know from a socioeconomic standpoint you know we have some racial diversity in our school but it's you know it's it's who lives in our community and it's pretty highly caucasian if that's a disqualifier well that you know we i don't know what what you think about that if if that's kind of one of your priorities i'm not sure we would meet that right so again like the way we look at the the high need student population it's not like just that's why i give like if i when when i was working in california new york like those regions like it was it was clear because there was a high overlap between unfortunately there was a high overlap between like students of color or free and reduced lunches like students eligible for free and reduced lunch i think in colorado one of the things that we are also learning is that like the the way the student demographics are in different districts like it's it so again there's no like there has to be a certain free and reduced lunch student population or there has to be a certain students of color we try to define it like in in respect to the district that or the student population that they're serving with respect to the state so overall like i think that still like i was looking at some of the numbers so you said like you are at six hundred students oh sorry six hundred students now and then looking to grow to eight hundred but then at around four hundred okay this this year we opened up some additional classes to kind of squeezing in available space but the extra really will take us from around four hundred to over six hundred got it and two hundred student increase got it legacy academy right like that's the official name yes legacy academy is the official name and there's a i think there's a legacy high school somewhere north part of denver that's that's not us okay legacy academy so the enrollment it was showing around five hundred fifty three last year k through eight odd that is that's including we have a home school support program oh got it got it those students count like half ppr got it thank you you're in a different building so that's probably why that number is a little different oh okay okay and then it shows around seventeen percent three hundred use lunch last year and yeah to your point like it has gone down because not there's no incentive to actually fill the form out so definitely like that's not the that's the trend we are seeing across and then looking at the other so merlin i think like one of the biggest things that again from the growth standpoint you are adding two hundred seats like that fits into like the schools that we are working with and how we provide the operating general operating grant to them and then it's on the schools if they want to use it for a facilities or they want to use it for specific like operating need but i think like from the student demographics perspective is where like i think it might it it will not fit where we like how our focus is because again like with limited philanthropy we're prioritizing and that's how what we have named for our board and for ourselves of like the schools that we want to work with so yeah i guess like that is the biggest thing but otherwise also like have you already identified the the team or like who the financing sources like who how you would be financing and the project management team for the construction yes we have owners rep that we've hired to do this and our architects about halfway through the projects he's got at least a mapinational design so we can get some price estimates for the construction okay so we we do have that in place okay got it yeah because i was thinking of like if there are other finance like other low cost financing sources you said usda might be one yeah because we're in a we're in albert county which qualifies us as a rural area the united states department of agriculture has a program they call community facilities fund yeah and we working with them for over a year and a half to get the funding that we need for for most of this yeah we do need to put in some of the funds ourselves so they'll fund about eighty to ninety percent of it got it so you said the project budget is around twenty million dollars and you're looking and let's say eighty percent eighty to eighty five percent comes from that so you're still so you have to internally raise somewhere around three million dollars yes okay and most of that we have just in reserves we built up the schools twenty some years old so we've we've got some nice reserves we just are looking for some grants it's part of what the usd like usda likes us to do is to talk to different possible other sources of funding to contribute to that and we've gotten a small donation and we have because a few you know few buckets of money that we have probably try to pay off that we have on our current building in the same process and that'll free up some cash and from the reserves on that so we've looked at a variety of ways to to kind of help offset that got it and like what's the current gap like if you're account for all different sources and users like is there still like i don't think we really have a gap okay but it would to do to use all of our own cash that would delete our reserves which yeah yeah good position long term but yeah we're advantage it like we are but we'd love to get some expansion help as well so got it are you all also like because you're expanding by two hundred students are you also thinking of like applying for the csp grant for the league yes okay yeah okay so yeah i think that we thought about applying in the first round but we really are financing them kind of just i mean working with federal agencies can be a really slow process that's true and so we push back so we'll apply in this next round okay okay yeah because you're still like in the process i think you should you all should still qualify so i think that could be one of the sources too not directly contribute towards facilities but can like you can utilize some of those funds you know things like furniture right right anything that doesn't attach to the building yeah yeah so that that could be another source yeah well unfortunately like looking at the student demographics and like what you shared that doesn't directly fit how we like the schools that we support but again like was trying to brainstorm like are there other opportunities that i know of where again like similar to daniel's fund like they have specific focus like we kind of focused on like the the schools that we are working on let me let me change track just a little bit sure i'm kind of semi retired and i work for legacy as a consultant a couple days a week one of the other things i'm working on is to do some new school startups okay and i what i'd like to do is send you an email with links to our that startup group's website because we would be starting and we'd like to start a school in pueblo we'd like to start a school in district eleven in colorado springs my son is up in fort collins and he would like to start at the school up there and so we do have some projects that we're working on that just like to at least send you our website tell you a little bit about what we're doing and you can kind of review that and maybe we could talk again in a few weeks yeah no that that would be interesting because for what you guys are working for okay yeah no that that would be good and and the geographies that you named like d eleven pueblo fort collins like at least in d eleven and pueblo we have already supported few startup schools there or expansion schools there because again it kind of ties to the the schools that we are looking to work with so like if yeah if there are new schools that you are looking or like you are working with to launch in these geographies would love to connect and learn more about about them as well yeah well also i'll send you a little more info about that and then maybe we can talk again in a few weeks yeah for sure yeah good luck to do that all right thank you yeah appreciate it thanks you too have a good one thanks",

        "summary": "The meeting discussed the expansion plans of Legacy Academy, a high-performing charter school in Colorado.

        "audioTranscript": "pretty good so far just starting catching up i was traveling last couple of days for work so just catching up on all my missed emails well pleasure to meet you to find out a little bit more about what you guys are doing and let you know what you'd like to know about us yeah sure so peter gave in that email exchange i got little context but would love to learn more about the school and the overall capital need that you all have the facilities but before that i can just quickly share brief introduction about myself and colorado schools fund what we do and how we support schools so that might give you the context in terms of and would love to learn more about legacy classical as well so i'm sudanshu i work for colorado schools fund lydia hoffman who's the ceo and i launched this fund last year so we are like little one and a half year into this but prior to that we both were working with charter school growth fund which works nationally and supports charter schools so the schools that we worked with and like our goal is to support charter school of charter schools now in colorado but the schools that we worked with like there are three main areas that we focus on one is schools that serve historically underserved students so the schools that we have worked so far with have like slightly higher free and reduced student lunch population or students of color or students with special needs like those are the schools that we typically work with and then the second is just the school quality piece so we kind of like geek out a lot on the data and understand like the whole academic story and like how they are serving the students and then the last one is more around the community need we support schools that provide school options and solve the community needs so coming from coming from the district versus like schools or like networks coming out of state and launching without understanding the need of the real community so i think that those three are like the biggest drivers for us on the type of schools we work with how we support schools are like there are multiple levels how we support but the biggest one is like for schools that are launching new schools or like for leaders who are launching new schools or schools that are expanding and adding anywhere between one hundred fifty to two hundred seats or more we provide startup or expansion grants to them so that is that is one part of it but outside of that also like we work with the network of consultants and experts who we have worked for like past ten plus years at the growth fund who provide like direct specific supports to schools like so for example if the school requires support around facilities or financing we work with them to kind of figure out like how we can support them if it's enrollment if it's academic improvement all the other areas like if the schools are part of our grand portfolio we provide all these additional supports to them as well so that's like a very quick high level of like our work but yeah would love to learn more about legacy and how you're yeah just just about the school and like how i can be helpful yeah what we legacy has started on an expansion campaign they will help us grow from around four hundred to a little over six hundred students okay we've done some pre design and pre pricing and things like that and so we're working with the us department of agriculture right now because elizabeth is kind of a semi rural area so we we think there's a chance we'll get some funding through the usda but we're also responsible for you know finding a percentage of the cost of the expansion doing kind of on our own so we have some assets that we have built up over the years in reserves but we're also looking for some startup grant type assistance you know obviously not asking for someone to fund the full twenty million that were that we need to expand our building but we that's kind of what we're looking for we do have high academic performance our our spf last year was in the mid seventies penn state of colorado so we are a pretty high performing school we don't tend to have a lot of free and reduced lunch and it's even lower the last couple years because people stop filling it out because they didn't need to fill it out to get free lunch that's true yeah that's the trend we are also seeing yeah back and forth but yeah and so we're that's a little bit about us you know as you were talking through some of the priorities that you guys usually look for we probably would not qualify under you know from a socioeconomic standpoint you know we have some racial diversity in our school but it's you know it's it's who lives in our community and it's pretty highly caucasian if that's a disqualifier well that you know we i don't know what what you think about that if if that's kind of one of your priorities i'm not sure we would meet that right so again like the way we look at the the high need student population it's not like just that's why i give like if i when when i was working in california new york like those regions like it was it was clear because there was a high overlap between unfortunately there was a high overlap between like students of color or free and reduced lunches like students eligible for free and reduced lunch i think in colorado one of the things that we are also learning is that like the the way the student demographics are in different districts like it's it so again there's no like there has to be a certain free and reduced lunch student population or there has to be a certain students of color we try to define it like in in respect to the district that or the student population that they're serving with respect to the state so overall like i think that still like i was looking at some of the numbers so you said like you are at six hundred students oh sorry six hundred students now and then looking to grow to eight hundred but then at around four hundred okay this this year we opened up some additional classes to kind of squeezing in available space but the extra really will take us from around four hundred to over six hundred got it and two hundred student increase got it legacy academy right like that's the official name yes legacy academy is the official name and there's a i think there's a legacy high school somewhere north part of denver that's that's not us okay legacy academy so the enrollment it was showing around five hundred fifty three last year k through eight odd that is that's including we have a home school support program oh got it got it those students count like half ppr got it thank you you're in a different building so that's probably why that number is a little different oh okay okay and then it shows around seventeen percent three hundred use lunch last year and yeah to your point like it has gone down because not there's no incentive to actually fill the form out so definitely like that's not the that's the trend we are seeing across and then looking at the other so merlin i think like one of the biggest things that again from the growth standpoint you are adding two hundred seats like that fits into like the schools that we are working with and how we provide the operating general operating grant to them and then it's on the schools if they want to use it for a facilities or they want to use it for specific like operating need but i think like from the student demographics perspective is where like i think it might it it will not fit where we like how our focus is because again like with limited philanthropy we're prioritizing and that's how what we have named for our board and for ourselves of like the schools that we want to work with so yeah i guess like that is the biggest thing but otherwise also like have you already identified the the team or like who the financing sources like who how you would be financing and the project management team for the construction yes we have owners rep that we've hired to do this and our architects about halfway through the projects he's got at least a mapinational design so we can get some price estimates for the construction okay so we we do have that in place okay got it yeah because i was thinking of like if there are other finance like other low cost financing sources you said usda might be one yeah because we're in a we're in albert county which qualifies us as a rural area the united states department of agriculture has a program they call community facilities fund yeah and we working with them for over a year and a half to get the funding that we need for for most of this yeah we do need to put in some of the funds ourselves so they'll fund about eighty to ninety percent of it got it so you said the project budget is around twenty million dollars and you're looking and let's say eighty percent eighty to eighty five percent comes from that so you're still so you have to internally raise somewhere around three million dollars yes okay and most of that we have just in reserves we built up the schools twenty some years old so we've we've got some nice reserves we just are looking for some grants it's part of what the usd like usda likes us to do is to talk to different possible other sources of funding to contribute to that and we've gotten a small donation and we have because a few you know few buckets of money that we have probably try to pay off that we have on our current building in the same process and that'll free up some cash and from the reserves on that so we've looked at a variety of ways to to kind of help offset that got it and like what's the current gap like if you're account for all different sources and users like is there still like i don't think we really have a gap okay but it would to do to use all of our own cash that would delete our reserves which yeah yeah good position long term but yeah we're advantage it like we are but we'd love to get some expansion help as well so got it are you all also like because you're expanding by two hundred students are you also thinking of like applying for the csp grant for the league yes okay yeah okay so yeah i think that we thought about applying in the first round but we really are financing them kind of just i mean working with federal agencies can be a really slow process that's true and so we push back so we'll apply in this next round okay okay yeah because you're still like in the process i think you should you all should still qualify so i think that could be one of the sources too not directly contribute towards facilities but can like you can utilize some of those funds you know things like furniture right right anything that doesn't attach to the building yeah yeah so that that could be another source yeah well unfortunately like looking at the student demographics and like what you shared that doesn't directly fit how we like the schools that we support but again like was trying to brainstorm like are there other opportunities that i know of where again like similar to daniel's fund like they have specific focus like we kind of focused on like the the schools that we are working on let me let me change track just a little bit sure i'm kind of semi retired and i work for legacy as a consultant a couple days a week one of the other things i'm working on is to do some new school startups okay and i what i'd like to do is send you an email with links to our that startup group's website because we would be starting and we'd like to start a school in pueblo we'd like to start a school in district eleven in colorado springs my son is up in fort collins and he would like to start at the school up there and so we do have some projects that we're working on that just like to at least send you our website tell you a little bit about what we're doing and you can kind of review that and maybe we could talk again in a few weeks yeah no that that would be interesting because for what you guys are working for okay yeah no that that would be good and and the geographies that you named like d eleven pueblo fort collins like at least in d eleven and pueblo we have already supported few startup schools there or expansion schools there because again it kind of ties to the the schools that we are looking to work with so like if yeah if there are new schools that you are looking or like you are working with to launch in these geographies would love to connect and learn more about about them as well yeah well also i'll send you a little more info about that and then maybe we can talk again in a few weeks yeah for sure yeah good luck to do that all right thank you yeah appreciate it thanks you too have a good one thanks",

first time to get flu so he was also trying to understand how to navigate that yeah i know you briefly mentioned in that email about the expansion or the charter expansion that you all are working on would love to learn more about that and then also happy to talk through colorado schools fund how we work with schools and the supports that we provide great like looked at your website a little bit more and i see that you're working with the rocky mountain outdoor school in fair play yeah hierarchies community school yeah sorry so that was interesting because they got released from the district we're authorized by parker two and our renewal is up next year so the twenty twenty six and i guess a little background we've been trying to do this expansion since about twenty twenty two and they've had we're now on the third superintendent since that time originally at one point cindy berg did approve us to do the best grant but things kind of fell through on our end because we had a different administrator and we just weren't prepared but with the current so last august so i've been with the school since twenty eighteen i guess i should go back i started in twenty eighteen as a fifth grade teacher and then i started working with our secondary program and then wanted to start working in kind of building that because we used to only have about ten to fifteen kids in sixth through eighth grade and so in twenty twenty two the twenty two twenty three school year we actually split out so that was a mixed stage group we split out six seven eight tab individual grades which was great but we started running out of space because we were only k through eight so i was teaching science and social studies and using one room the next year we rolled up so those eighth graders became ninth graders and so we had high school and so we've added about fifteen students each year since then and we were able to get some modulars so we have four classrooms but right now between middle school high school we have about seventy students and essentially five and a half classroom spaces five to six so we're really running out of space here and so last year at the beginning of school year the board our treasurer and myself we did a presentation to the school district asking for their support basically just to sign off on the best grants so that we could do an addition to our school and they cut us off mid presentation and said they're just not going to talk to us anymore about it if we want to we can have lawyers discuss it but they're not going to support it because they're worried that we won't be able to have enough enrollment to support it but we've been increasing our per pupil count like every year and theirs is actually declining when they take out our enrollment so it's kind of weird i don't know why we're like an hour drive from fair play right our students won't go to their school they'll go to woodland park or cripple creek or home school so it's a weird fight that we're in right now so we're trying to see like they won't even give us so we added this expansion into all our documents for the renewal process but they said they won't honor that like we can do amendments but they're not even going to look at it until like next like until the spring and so then that puts us another year behind on the best grant and you know we don't really have any collateral or assets because technically they own the building so it's just it's a weird it's a weird system right now and we just haven't had a very positive relationship with park re two so just a couple of questions so right now i was looking at and correct me if i'm looking at the wrong data but so yours is a pre k through twelve school and based on the last year's enrollment data that we have it was one hundred fifty two full students that you had across pre k twelve okay and then you said that for expansion especially in middle and high school grades because like yeah your fourth grade is almost nineteen students but then it drops because of the space constraints maybe this is dropping from there we have kind of two i think it was kind of covid and other things we had some dips in enrollment so some of our elementary classes have been smaller got it but the idea is we kind of always the goal has been elementary classrooms could be twenty students and then looking at maybe even high school going up to twenty five but we definitely like the small class size feel got it and then from the district engagement perspective so for this expansion like do you need a charter amendment like is there a restriction on number of total number of students and will the expansion require you to go through an amendment of your charter so i mean they've approved us to have high school okay we say it's okay that we can do use the modulars but we're really limited right now we don't have a twelveth grade class and there's only five students in our eleventh grade but as each grade goes up that's going to increase so we can combine ten and eleventh grade for certain classes you know we can combine high school for different electives but we're getting to a point where i don't know if we can serve the students where we're at and for us to secure any sort of funding to build an addition or another building as of right now with our charter agreement we have to get their permission okay so for any additional expansion either not if not necessarily the charter amendment but at least from the district space or like facilities construction space like you will require there okay and the hold up from like or like the pushback from their side is that they're worried about their enrollment going down and like that is that or like is that the cost of this new construction is that the limiting factor that i think the word will fail and that they will be left with an unfinished like construction project or like a school building that they have to fill and they can't got it okay that's my guess that's the best guess i have for it i suppose part of it could be they just are overwhelmed with running their schools and they just don't have time for us and they just don't want to deal with it as i think part of it but yeah because so one thing from like the situation what i'm understanding is because like you don't own the space and like doing anything or like bringing any any capital construction like for construction or addition into this like most of like if i look at the sources of like if this comes through some kind of a low cost loan like the the difficulty is that since you don't own the land like it is difficult for lenders to underwrite it to basically say that what's the yeah and then like for grants like even for the grants like based on what i know like the foundations that i know that do this kind of work i think for them is there is your lease is your lease like a long term lease with thirty i would say it's a thirty year and i think it actually comes up it's not even a lease we don't it's because they used to best grant in i think it was like ninety something to build it so i think the agreements with best and the school district and i think it's up in twenty twenty nine okay and i i don't think there's much due on it because i think originally there was like a mill levy or something like that that paid for it so we don't pay anything to the district to use this space and to my knowledge they don't charge us anything and they're not paying anything to like the state or anything like i think it's actually paid for that's one thing we've been trying to work with like lawyers to even find what would it cost for us to buy the building and the property that we're on so that we could just go on and then maybe secure funding or something along those lines got it we would need we're kind of in the chicken egg where it's like if we find out what it costs like right now with our current charter agreement we'd still need they would have to be willing to like negotiate the sale of the property right and i that's more legal stuff than i than is my yeah so even even if you like so there are more cases of like district buying it from charters that i know versus like the other way like in this case the charter school would have to go through this process but even before like thinking about that like i'm just curious like based on your financials like do you have capacity to finance this purchase because so i know like typically like the schools that we work with except for hierarchies and some of the other you know more innovative schools like typically schools that we work with have like three hundred fifty to four hundred student enrollment so for them like they have like ten to twenty ten to twelve percent of their revenue goes towards facilities lease or dead service so they have that budgeted for and that's how they operate so i'm just curious because you're not paying any signal like lease maybe some facilities operating that you're paying but like if you're not paying so is there capacity in your budget to kind of finance if like that's enough yep capacity in the sense of you know we were paying rent or were we releasing our modulars and we did just actually secure a loan to purchase them outright and then we'll have that as one asset where we could you know sell and use those as you know you know some funding sources as well and we have worked with because we started working with i can't think of his name right now someone who was talking about if we were in good standing with a bank and everything along those lines so we can get letters of like support for our project to get some support and we do have a five year budget plan and i had pulled it up and there is in that plan maybe i could just send that to you even but there are business manager has been building in some capital reserves essentially to go towards this expansion project okay so we don't have a huge it's not huge right now and that's where we're at we're just trying to find we can run a tight budget because you know we've been paying i suppose one thing we're looking at is if we did move to csi you know the district does charge us the full five percent of our flow through from state funding if we went to csi technically we would have you know five percent of our annual revenue would be coming back that we could have to put into the capital construction yeah my guess is like csi also has some admin fee but yeah that will still be net positive for for you all okay because that is what i'm wondering like smaller schools especially around one hundred fifty two hundred student enrollment like owning their own facility i've seen very few examples of that that's why i was asking of like is there enough margin to to do that more where it's like a rent or a lease yeah typically it has been a lease or a rent or like even if they like in case they own like it's it's much like below market or like reduced cost purchase especially in current market like the the real estate prices are high so depending on so typically what we the schools that we work with we suggest that like you look at your budget and see what's the maximum you can pay annually and use that number to figure out that hey this is the maximum purchase price that we can go to because like let's say like let again just for purpose of this i haven't seen the budget but like let's say if they say that you can afford one hundred thousand dollars a year to pay for lease or debt service so instead of so if if that is the case then you can basically say that if you have to take like a twenty five year loan on that and pay one hundred k every year what would it like how much how much you can borrow right so that basically is like you're ask like price that you would you can maximum pay now if district has an incentive to sell it to you or like if if they basically are like heavier selling like if they don't want to sell below market or if that doesn't work for them i think that would be a tricky situation so but like at least the starting point is to understand like your own affordability and start those conversations but then again like so that is that that will give you the the minimum that you can or like the but then there are other sources like if you have like if you raise capital through like fundraising or or through philanthropic organization like that can also go on top of that like if there is if there is like not much of a gap between what they are asking and what you can afford like then that gap can be raised through and i know we don't directly do capital grants for facilities we typically do like more operating grants for the school and these are like limited like for for two to three years like similarly hierarchies we are only supporting for like first three years because it's more of a startup expansion phase and that is when you people need more operating surplus but ongoing basis like we we don't provide capital funding but there are few other foundations that we work with that we know do capital giving as well so so like yeah depending on like but again it totally depends on how much is that gap between what's the skin price and what you can afford because all the foundations also has certain limits on on like how much they can give so so that is what would be helpful to understand like if if you go that route is is what i make sense thinking but otherwise i can share a quickly like little bit about colorado schools fund how we work with with schools so we started last year we launched this fund last year so it's been year and a half now since we have been in existence our goal is like three like we work with schools with like three main aspects one is like we look at schools that are serving either historically underserved students like more low income families or students of color or like high special needs student population or or like places like park county where there there are not like you said like when we were first driving to hierarchies the starting of park county to where their location is it was like almost sixty five minute drive so i was like okay this and that on a good day i was coming from denver yeah yeah so we are like sixty five miles the other direction from where high rise well the the other side of more on the summer got it it doesn't have a hospital oh wow so so yeah i think like that looking at that spread of like one school to serve like hour and a half to two hours kind of drive is is just so that is where like we work with schools of like our our schools providing access to families where they don't have other good options or so so that is that is like first bucket the second bucket is like we look at the school quality like how schools are serving the students on basis on their academic performance and then we also understand like each school is serving a different student population so there is context so we kind of use some of the we work with a couple of consultants who help us like contextualize the the data in terms of the student population that that schools are serving and then the last thing is more about like the community need which is like we don't want like schools from outside to just come and say that hey we will serve this community it's more like does the community really need this and is there enough parent demand to do that so those are the three big buckets of schools that we work with now how we support schools is basically so we work with new and expanding schools so new schools like hierarchies launched this year so we we support those so so far like in the last one and a half year we have supported nine schools both i think half of them are new schools and half of them are expansion and then for expansion we typically work with schools that are adding it at least one hundred new students and and how we support is basically provide them like a limited time grant like multi year grant because a lot of new schools like as they are ramping up their enrollment there is a startup capital need so that is what we typically provide but it is generally it is a general operating grant so like if schools already like expanding schools generally have some cash reserves so they don't need the startup funding so they some of them basically use it to put towards facilities it's flexible but as long as like it's it's knowing that it is only for the limited time and like not the ongoing funding is how we is how we support yeah so so that's like the high level of like how we work with schools yeah oh great well and i feel like we kind of fit all of those buckets so one question i had related to that like when you said expansion like how many new seats or like new students based on let's say one hundred fifty two was your twenty twenty five enrollment like how many new students you would be serving so the five year plan i'm trying to see i think what we were thinking is we could eventually get to about two hundred eighty so we're looking to add about a hundred students over the next i mean i guess i should say really even four years so getting close to three hundred students k through twelve three hundred student okay got it i think i think from from like if that is the growth plan to get to one hundred fifty students i think that that kind of fits that framework but i think like the biggest question to that would be just the paths to growth in terms of like i think in your case it's the facilities that's the biggest barrier to growth and then i'll also have to do like some little bit of like digging into the data to understand the academic performance and how we look at it but curious on like the the facilities pathway because like our grant typically doesn't solve for what what your need is so i'm just curious alternate ways to work around the district because if they are the roadblock and they're like one like because they own the building it doesn't like it's difficult to get financing or so yeah that that's the big question i'm trying to figure out in terms of like how we can work and like go more into the diligence process to understand better just the facilities barrier and the work around that and i wonder and maybe that's something i can have our principal ask our attorneys is if like we can kind of i mean we've been asking for this but like what would that look like you know they don't want to support us doing anything to the facilities kind of like you were saying what is our like what can we afford but what are they like what is what are they willing to kind of like sell the building for yeah i think that that that is a path to to explore is that like in the long term again i would say like that's one of the parts to explore because like owning a building and going for a private date comes at a certain financial risk is that then you will have to meet your enrollment goals to make sure you are able to afford and pay debt so so that's the trade off like so making sure that one like confidence and enrollment in terms of like being able to get to that number that you're budgeting for and then yeah just understanding like one like first question like would they even be open to a sale yeah and then sale though i guess they can right i mean if they own the property they can deny a sales yes yeah they are like yeah i mean then the other option is like i used to work a lot in california and that is this is the similar challenge that most of the schools face there so they had a they had a law by law like schools had to provide district space to charter schools but then like the conditions they used to make it so difficult that like charters were stuck there with like no expansion so that's why like a lot of growing charters preferred using that for only first two three years to prove their enrollment and then move to a private facility which they not directly related to the district but again like finding a new facility like making sure your community you have a community buy in to do that also because again moving places comes at a significant switching cost that and then yeah just the pricing of it i think those are the three big questions to kind of figure out one other big component too is we're on the teller and park county line i mean we're like a mile and or maybe two miles from that line so a lot of our students are actually in tiller county ok it's kind of a unique area in that sense whereas like if we got locations if we go too far west i don't know that we would keep i don't think we'd have as much community buy in so we want to stay close to where and then the last alternate path which i'm not sure i'm just thinking about is that if you stay in this space current conditions and if you do like what district allow for like additional like putting more modulars or putting more additional construction there so they can own this space the only challenge there would be that you would be spending your like school will be spending their capital to build that space which we don't get anything out of it yeah yeah yeah so like if two years three years down the line district is basically like oh we are not supporting charters or like we want to like they're board basically says that there's some like because your school is specially appro like up for like lease is up for renwell in twenty twenty nine and they are like ok now we don't want to do that like you basically have spent the money on a land which you don't even continue so so that is the biggest risk around that but like that is the path which if you figure out like a long term like renewal of your lease alongside this for the next twenty twenty five years then this path becomes easy like a better solution right then you don't have to spend like full whatever x thousand or x million dollars to buy this versus like just do the additional construction right right now so when you said you know sometimes color school's fund would fund like operating costs would that be something where we could maybe you know request from you funding to support like attorney fees to help us work through or would you want to like how restrictive or so again like for us like we provide grants like once we have done our diligence and there is clarity on the growth path so but what you are saying is like a step before that in terms of like like you have to figure out the growth path before that so so on that like those are the grants that we don't like we typically do it like once the growth grants and then then it's on school on how they want to utilize it like they want to use it for an attorney or facilities or just first three years of startup capital sure but i think in your case what you're saying is like engaging the attorney up front to figure out a growth path yeah yeah yeah so i yeah yeah okay well would you want me to i don't know if it's helpful or not but to send that kind of five year budget narrative yeah if you can share the five year budget and then i will look up the academics like the the framework that we use on the academic side so yeah just reviewing those two things would be unhelpful indication for us to again we do like a more detailed diligence process once we engage and like but at least like this would be a good way to for us to understand like to move to that step but again like as i said like facilities would be the biggest like understanding that would be critical before we move forward so yeah for sure and i do also have the presentation that we did to the district where it included our kind of our community buy in and what parents were saying is that something i guess you would want to see that down the road or yeah at some point yeah once we once like there is paths to grow then we do like more detailed diligence process would love to see that okay cool yeah i think i think yeah let's let's as the next steps like share that information i'll dig into the academics and then depending on your internal conversation around the facilities path like we can probably reconnect in a few weeks if that works yeah that sounds great okay cool so yeah let's stay in touch anything else i can be helpful but no i think that sounds good i will talk with the others and then yeah we'll follow up okay sounds good thanks for your time",

          "content": "and thank you for time to meet with me yeah no thank you sorry i had to reschedule last week sorry about that how's your child doing he's doing better he had flu and this was his first time to get flu so he was also trying to understand how to navigate that yeah i know you briefly mentioned in that email about the expansion or the charter expansion that you all are working on would love to learn more about that and then also happy to talk through colorado schools fund how we work with schools and the supports that we provide great like looked at your website a little bit more and i see that you're working with the rocky mountain outdoor school in fair play yeah hierarchies community school yeah sorry so that was interesting because they got released from the district we're authorized by parker two and our renewal is up next year so the twenty twenty six and i guess a little background we've been trying to do this expansion since about twenty twenty two and they've had we're now on the third superintendent since that time originally at one point cindy berg did approve us to do the best grant but things kind of fell through on our end because we had a different administrator and we just weren't prepared but with the current so last august so i've been with the school since twenty eighteen i guess i should go back i started in twenty eighteen as a fifth grade teacher and then i started working with our secondary program and then wanted to start working in kind of building that because we used to only have about ten to fifteen kids in sixth through eighth grade and so in twenty twenty two the twenty two twenty three school year we actually split out so that was a mixed stage group we split out six seven eight tab individual grades which was great but we started running out of space because we were only k through eight so i was teaching science and social studies and using one room the next year we rolled up so those eighth graders became ninth graders and so we had high school and so we've added about fifteen students each year since then and we were able to get some modulars so we have four classrooms but right now between middle school high school we have about seventy students and essentially five and a half classroom spaces five to six so we're really running out of space here and so last year at the beginning of school year the board our treasurer and myself we did a presentation to the school district asking for their support basically just to sign off on the best grants so that we could do an addition to our school and they cut us off mid presentation and said they're just not going to talk to us anymore about it if we want to we can have lawyers discuss it but they're not going to support it because they're worried that we won't be able to have enough enrollment to support it but we've been increasing our per pupil count like every year and theirs is actually declining when they take out our enrollment so it's kind of weird i don't know why we're like an hour drive from fair play right our students won't go to their school they'll go to woodland park or cripple creek or home school so it's a weird fight that we're in right now so we're trying to see like they won't even give us so we added this expansion into all our documents for the renewal process but they said they won't honor that like we can do amendments but they're not even going to look at it until like next like until the spring and so then that puts us another year behind on the best grant and you know we don't really have any collateral or assets because technically they own the building so it's just it's a weird it's a weird system right now and we just haven't had a very positive relationship with park re two so just a couple of questions so right now i was looking at and correct me if i'm looking at the wrong data but so yours is a pre k through twelve school and based on the last year's enrollment data that we have it was one hundred fifty two full students that you had across pre k twelve okay and then you said that for expansion especially in middle and high school grades because like yeah your fourth grade is almost nineteen students but then it drops because of the space constraints maybe this is dropping from there we have kind of two i think it was kind of covid and other things we had some dips in enrollment so some of our elementary classes have been smaller got it but the idea is we kind of always the goal has been elementary classrooms could be twenty students and then looking at maybe even high school going up to twenty five but we definitely like the small class size feel got it and then from the district engagement perspective so for this expansion like do you need a charter amendment like is there a restriction on number of total number of students and will the expansion require you to go through an amendment of your charter so i mean they've approved us to have high school okay we say it's okay that we can do use the modulars but we're really limited right now we don't have a twelveth grade class and there's only five students in our eleventh grade but as each grade goes up that's going to increase so we can combine ten and eleventh grade for certain classes you know we can combine high school for different electives but we're getting to a point where i don't know if we can serve the students where we're at and for us to secure any sort of funding to build an addition or another building as of right now with our charter agreement we have to get their permission okay so for any additional expansion either not if not necessarily the charter amendment but at least from the district space or like facilities construction space like you will require there okay and the hold up from like or like the pushback from their side is that they're worried about their enrollment going down and like that is that or like is that the cost of this new construction is that the limiting factor that i think the word will fail and that they will be left with an unfinished like construction project or like a school building that they have to fill and they can't got it okay that's my guess that's the best guess i have for it i suppose part of it could be they just are overwhelmed with running their schools and they just don't have time for us and they just don't want to deal with it as i think part of it but yeah because so one thing from like the situation what i'm understanding is because like you don't own the space and like doing anything or like bringing any any capital construction like for construction or addition into this like most of like if i look at the sources of like if this comes through some kind of a low cost loan like the the difficulty is that since you don't own the land like it is difficult for lenders to underwrite it to basically say that what's the yeah and then like for grants like even for the grants like based on what i know like the foundations that i know that do this kind of work i think for them is there is your lease is your lease like a long term lease with thirty i would say it's a thirty year and i think it actually comes up it's not even a lease we don't it's because they used to best grant in i think it was like ninety something to build it so i think the agreements with best and the school district and i think it's up in twenty twenty nine okay and i i don't think there's much due on it because i think originally there was like a mill levy or something like that that paid for it so we don't pay anything to the district to use this space and to my knowledge they don't charge us anything and they're not paying anything to like the state or anything like i think it's actually paid for that's one thing we've been trying to work with like lawyers to even find what would it cost for us to buy the building and the property that we're on so that we could just go on and then maybe secure funding or something along those lines got it we would need we're kind of in the chicken egg where it's like if we find out what it costs like right now with our current charter agreement we'd still need they would have to be willing to like negotiate the sale of the property right and i that's more legal stuff than i than is my yeah so even even if you like so there are more cases of like district buying it from charters that i know versus like the other way like in this case the charter school would have to go through this process but even before like thinking about that like i'm just curious like based on your financials like do you have capacity to finance this purchase because so i know like typically like the schools that we work with except for hierarchies and some of the other you know more innovative schools like typically schools that we work with have like three hundred fifty to four hundred student enrollment so for them like they have like ten to twenty ten to twelve percent of their revenue goes towards facilities lease or dead service so they have that budgeted for and that's how they operate so i'm just curious because you're not paying any signal like lease maybe some facilities operating that you're paying but like if you're not paying so is there capacity in your budget to kind of finance if like that's enough yep capacity in the sense of you know we were paying rent or were we releasing our modulars and we did just actually secure a loan to purchase them outright and then we'll have that as one asset where we could you know sell and use those as you know you know some funding sources as well and we have worked with because we started working with i can't think of his name right now someone who was talking about if we were in good standing with a bank and everything along those lines so we can get letters of like support for our project to get some support and we do have a five year budget plan and i had pulled it up and there is in that plan maybe i could just send that to you even but there are business manager has been building in some capital reserves essentially to go towards this expansion project okay so we don't have a huge it's not huge right now and that's where we're at we're just trying to find we can run a tight budget because you know we've been paying i suppose one thing we're looking at is if we did move to csi you know the district does charge us the full five percent of our flow through from state funding if we went to csi technically we would have you know five percent of our annual revenue would be coming back that we could have to put into the capital construction yeah my guess is like csi also has some admin fee but yeah that will still be net positive for for you all okay because that is what i'm wondering like smaller schools especially around one hundred fifty two hundred student enrollment like owning their own facility i've seen very few examples of that that's why i was asking of like is there enough margin to to do that more where it's like a rent or a lease yeah typically it has been a lease or a rent or like even if they like in case they own like it's it's much like below market or like reduced cost purchase especially in current market like the the real estate prices are high so depending on so typically what we the schools that we work with we suggest that like you look at your budget and see what's the maximum you can pay annually and use that number to figure out that hey this is the maximum purchase price that we can go to because like let's say like let again just for purpose of this i haven't seen the budget but like let's say if they say that you can afford one hundred thousand dollars a year to pay for lease or debt service so instead of so if if that is the case then you can basically say that if you have to take like a twenty five year loan on that and pay one hundred k every year what would it like how much how much you can borrow right so that basically is like you're ask like price that you would you can maximum pay now if district has an incentive to sell it to you or like if if they basically are like heavier selling like if they don't want to sell below market or if that doesn't work for them i think that would be a tricky situation so but like at least the starting point is to understand like your own affordability and start those conversations but then again like so that is that that will give you the the minimum that you can or like the but then there are other sources like if you have like if you raise capital through like fundraising or or through philanthropic organization like that can also go on top of that like if there is if there is like not much of a gap between what they are asking and what you can afford like then that gap can be raised through and i know we don't directly do capital grants for facilities we typically do like more operating grants for the school and these are like limited like for for two to three years like similarly hierarchies we are only supporting for like first three years because it's more of a startup expansion phase and that is when you people need more operating surplus

totally depends on how much is that gap between what's the skin price and what you can afford because all the foundations also has certain limits on on like how much they can give so so that is what

        "summary": "and thank you for time to meet with me yeah no thank you sorry i had to reschedule last week sorry about that how's your child doing he's doing better he had flu and this was his first time to get flu so he was also trying to understand how to navigate that yeah i know you briefly mentioned in that email about the expansion or the charter expansion that you all are working on would love to learn more about that and then also happy to talk through colorado schools fund how we work with schools and the supports that we provide great like looked at your website a little bit more and i see that you're working with the rocky mountain outdoor school in fair play yeah hierarchies community school yeah sorry so that was interesting because they got released from the district we're authorized by parker two and our renewal is up next year so the twenty twenty six and i guess a little background we've been trying to do this expansion since about twenty twenty two and they've had we're now on the third superintendent since that time originally at one point cindy berg did approve us to do the best grant but things kind of fell through on our end because we had a different administrator and we just weren't prepared but with the current so last august so i've been with the school since twenty eighteen i guess i should go back i started in twenty eighteen as a fifth grade teacher and then i started working with our secondary program and then wanted to start working in kind of building that because we used to only have about ten to fifteen kids in sixth through eighth grade and so in twenty twenty two the twenty two twenty three school year we actually split out so that was a mixed stage group we split out six seven eight tab individual grades which was great but we started running out of space because we were only k through eight so i was teaching science and social studies and using one room the next year we rolled up so those eighth graders became ninth graders and so we had high school and so we've added about fifteen students each year since then and we were able to get some modulars so we have four classrooms but right now between middle school high school we have about seventy students and essentially five and a half classroom spaces five to six so we're really running out of space here and so last year at the beginning of school year the board our treasurer and myself we did a presentation to the school district asking for their support basically just to sign off on the best grants so that we could do an addition to our school and they cut us off mid presentation and said they're just not going to talk to us anymore about it if we want to we can have lawyers discuss it but they're not going to support it because they're worried that we won't be able to have enough enrollment to support it but we've been increasing our per pupil count like every year and theirs is actually declining when they take out our enrollment so it's kind of weird i don't know why we're like an hour drive from fair play right our students won't go to their school they'll go to woodland park or cripple creek or home school so it's a weird fight that we're in right now so we're trying to see like they won't even give us so we added this expansion into all our documents for the renewal process but they said they won't honor that like we can do amendments but they're not even going to look at it until like next like until the spring and so then that puts us another year behind on the best grant and you know we don't really have any collateral or assets because technically they own the building so it's just it's a weird it's a weird system right now and we just haven't had a very positive relationship with park re two so just a couple of questions so right now i was looking at and correct me if i'm looking at the wrong data but so yours is a pre k through twelve school and based on the last year's enrollment data that we have it was one hundred fifty two full students that you had across pre k twelve okay and then you said that for expansion especially in middle and high school grades because like yeah your fourth grade is almost nineteen students but then it drops because of the space constraints maybe this is dropping from there we have kind of two i think it was kind of covid and other things we had some dips in enrollment so some of our elementary classes have been smaller got it but the idea is we kind of always the goal has been elementary classrooms could be twenty students and then looking at maybe even high school going up to twenty five but we definitely like the small class size feel got it and then from the district engagement perspective so for this expansion like do you need a charter amendment like is there a restriction on number of total number of students and will the expansion require you to go through an amendment of your charter so i mean they've approved us to have high school okay we say it's okay that we can do use the modulars but we're really limited right now we don't have a twelveth grade class and there's only five students in our eleventh grade but as each grade goes up that's going to increase so we can combine ten and eleventh grade for certain classes you know we can combine high school for different electives but we're getting to a point where i don't know if we can serve the students where we're at and for us to secure any sort of funding to build an addition or another building as of right now with our charter agreement we have to get their permission okay so for any additional expansion either not if not necessarily the charter amendment but at least from the district space or like facilities construction space like you will require there okay and the hold up from like or like the pushback from their side is that they're worried about their enrollment going down and like that is that or like is that the cost of this new construction is that the limiting factor that i think the word will fail and that they will be left with an unfinished like construction project or like a school building that they have to fill and they can't got it okay that's my guess that's the best guess i have for it i suppose part of it could be they just are overwhelmed with running their schools and they just don't have time for us and they just don't want to deal with it as i think part of it but yeah because so one thing from like the situation what i'm understanding is because like you don't own the space and like doing anything or like bringing any any capital construction like for construction or addition into this like most of like if i look at the sources of like if this comes through some kind of a low cost loan like the the difficulty is that since you don't own the land like it is difficult for lenders to underwrite it to basically say that what's the yeah and then like for grants like even for the grants like based on what i know like the foundations that i know that do this kind of work i think for them is there is your lease is your lease like a long term lease with thirty i would say it's a thirty year and i think it actually comes up it's not even a lease we don't it's because they used to best grant in i think it was like ninety something to build it so i think the agreements with best and the school district and i think it's up in twenty twenty nine okay and i i don't think there's much due on it because i think originally there was like a mill levy or something like that that paid for it so we don't pay anything to the district to use this space and to my knowledge they don't charge us anything and they're not paying anything to like the state or anything like i think it's actually paid for that's one thing we've been trying to work with like lawyers to even find what would it cost for us to buy the building and the property that we're on so that we could just go on and then maybe secure funding or something along those lines got it we would need we're kind of in the chicken egg where it's like if we find out what it costs like right now with our current charter agreement we'd still need they would have to be willing to like negotiate the sale of the property right and i that's more legal stuff than i than is my yeah so even even if you like so there are more cases of like district buying it from charters that i know versus like the other way like in this case the charter school would have to go through this process but even before like thinking about that like i'm just curious like based on your financials like do you have capacity to finance this purchase because so i know like typically like the schools that we work with except for hierarchies and some of the other you know more innovative schools like typically schools that we work with have like three hundred fifty to four hundred student enrollment so for them like they have like ten to twenty ten to twelve percent of their revenue goes towards facilities lease or dead service so they have that budgeted for and that's how they operate so i'm just curious because you're not paying any signal like lease maybe some facilities operating that you're paying but like if you're not paying so is there capacity in your budget to kind of finance if like that's enough yep capacity in the sense of you know we were paying rent or were we releasing our modulars and we did just actually secure a loan to purchase them outright and then we'll have that as one asset where we could you know sell and use those as you know you know some funding sources as well and we have worked with because we started working with i can't think of his name right now someone who was talking about if we were in good standing with a bank and everything along those lines so we can get letters of like support for our project to get some support and we do have a five year budget plan and i had pulled it up and there is in that plan maybe i could just send that to you even but there are business manager has been building in some capital reserves essentially to go towards this expansion project okay so we don't have a huge it's not huge right now and that's where we're at we're just trying to find we can run a tight budget because you know we've been paying i suppose one thing we're looking at is if we did move to csi you know the district does charge us the full five percent of our flow through from state funding if we went to csi technically we would have you know five percent of our annual revenue would be coming back that we could have to put into the capital construction yeah my guess is like csi also has some admin fee but yeah that will still be net positive for for you all okay because that is what i'm wondering like smaller schools especially around one hundred fifty two hundred student enrollment like owning their own facility i've seen very few examples of that that's why i was asking of like is there enough margin to to do that more where it's like a rent or a lease yeah typically it has been a lease or a rent or like even if they like in case they own like it's it's much like below market or like reduced cost purchase especially in current market like the the real estate prices are high so depending on so typically what we the schools that we work with we suggest that like you look at your budget and see what's the maximum you can pay annually and use that number to figure out that hey this is the maximum purchase price that we can go to because like let's say like let again just for purpose of this i haven't seen the budget but like let's say if they say that you can afford one hundred thousand dollars a year to pay for lease or debt service so instead of so if if that is the case then you can basically say that if you have to take like a twenty five year loan on that and pay one hundred k every year what would it like how much how much you can borrow right so that basically is like you're ask like price that you would you can maximum pay now if district has an incentive to sell it to you or like if if they basically are like heavier selling like if they don't want to sell below market or if that doesn't work for them i think that would be a tricky situation so but like at least the starting point is to understand like your own affordability and start those conversations but then again like so that is that that will give you the the minimum that you can or like the but then there are other sources like if you have like if you raise capital through like fundraising or or through philanthropic organization like that can also go on top of that like if there is if there is like not much of a gap between what they are asking and what you can afford like then that gap can be raised through and i know we don't directly do capital grants for facilities we typically do like more operating grants for the school and these are like limited like for for two to three years like similarly hierarchies we are only supporting for like first three years because it's more of a startup expansion phase and that is when you people need more operating surplus but ongoing basis like we we don't provide capital funding but there are few other foundations that we work with that we know do capital giving as well so so like yeah depending on like but again it totally depends on how much is that gap between what's the skin price and what you can afford because all the foundations also has certain limits on on like how much they can give so so that is what would be helpful to understand like if if you go that route is is what i make sense thinking but otherwise i can share a quickly like little bit about colorado schools fund how we work with with schools so we started last year we launched this fund last year so it's been year and a half now since we have been in existence our goal is like three like we work with schools with like three main aspects one is like we look at schools that are serving either historically underserved students like more low income families or students of color or like high special needs student population or or like places like park county where there there are not like you said like when we were first driving to hierarchies the starting of park county to where their location is it was like almost sixty five minute drive so i was like okay this and that on a good day i was coming from denver yeah yeah so we are like sixty five miles the other direction from where high rise well the the other side of more on the summer got it it doesn't have a hospital oh wow so so yeah i think like that looking at that spread of like one school to serve like hour and a half to two hours kind of drive is is just so that is where like we work with schools of like our our schools providing access to families where they don't have other good options or so so that is that is like first bucket the second bucket is like we look at the school quality like how schools are serving the students on basis on their academic performance and then we also understand like each school is serving a different student population so there is context so we kind of use some of the we work with a couple of consultants who help us like contextualize the the data in terms of the student population that that schools are serving and then the last thing is more about like the community need which is like we don't want like schools from outside to just come and say that hey we will serve this community it's more like does the community really need this and is there enough parent demand to do that so those are the three big buckets of schools that we work with now how we support schools is basically so we work with new and expanding schools so new schools like hierarchies launched this year so we we support those so so far like in the last one and a half year we have supported nine schools both i think half of them are new schools and half of them are expansion and then for expansion we typically work with schools that are adding it at least one hundred new students and and how we support is basically provide them like a limited time grant like multi year grant because a lot of new schools like as they are ramping up their enrollment there is a startup capital need so that is what we typically provide but it is generally it is a general operating grant so like if schools already like expanding schools generally have some cash reserves so they don't need the startup funding so they some of them basically use it to put towards facilities it's flexible but as long as like it's it's knowing that it is only for the limited time and like not the ongoing funding is how we is how we support yeah so so that's like the high level of like how we work with schools yeah oh great well and i feel like we kind of fit all of those buckets so one question i had related to that like when you said expansion like how many new seats or like new students based on let's say one hundred fifty two was your twenty twenty five enrollment like how many new students you would be serving so the five year plan i'm trying to see i think what we were thinking is we could eventually get to about two hundred eighty so we're looking to add about a hundred students over the next i mean i guess i should say really even four years so getting close to three hundred students k through twelve three hundred student okay got it i think i think from from like if that is the growth plan to get to one hundred fifty students i think that that kind of fits that framework but i think like the biggest question to that would be just the paths to growth in terms of like i think in your case it's the facilities that's the biggest barrier to growth and then i'll also have to do like some little bit of like digging into the data to understand the academic performance and how we look at it but curious on like the the facilities pathway because like our grant typically doesn't solve for what what your need is so i'm just curious alternate ways to work around the district because if they are the roadblock and they're like one like because they own the building it doesn't like it's difficult to get financing or so yeah that that's the big question i'm trying to figure out in terms of like how we can work and like go more into the diligence process to understand better just the facilities barrier and the work around that and i wonder and maybe that's something i can have our principal ask our attorneys is if like we can kind of i mean we've been asking for this but like what would that look like you know they don't want to support us doing anything to the facilities kind of like you were saying what is our like what can we afford but what are they like what is what are they willing to kind of like sell the building for yeah i think that that that is a path to to explore is that like in the long term again i would say like that's one of the parts to explore because like owning a building and going for a private date comes at a certain financial risk is that then you will have to meet your enrollment goals to make sure you are able to afford and pay debt so so that's the trade off like so making sure that one like confidence and enrollment in terms of like being able to get to that number that you're budgeting for and then yeah just understanding like one like first question like would they even be open to a sale yeah and then sale though i guess they can right i mean if they own the property they can deny a sales yes yeah they are like yeah i mean then the other option is like i used to work a lot in california and that is this is the similar challenge that most of the schools face there so they had a they had a law by law like schools had to provide district space to charter schools but then like the conditions they used to make it so difficult that like charters were stuck there with like no expansion so that's why like a lot of growing charters preferred using that for only first two three years to prove their enrollment and then move to a private facility which they not directly related to the district but again like finding a new facility like making sure your community you have a community buy in to do that also because again moving places comes at a significant switching cost that and then yeah just the pricing of it i think those are the three big questions to kind of figure out one other big component too is we're on the teller and park county line i mean we're like a mile and or maybe two miles from that line so a lot of our students are actually in tiller county ok it's kind of a unique area in that sense whereas like if we got locations if we go too far west i don't know that we would keep i don't think we'd have as much community buy in so we want to stay close to where and then the last alternate path which i'm not sure i'm just thinking about is that if you stay in this space current conditions and if you do like what district allow for like additional like putting more modulars or putting more additional construction there so they can own this space the only challenge there would be that you would be spending your like school will be spending their capital to build that space which we don't get anything out of it yeah yeah yeah so like if two years three years down the line district is basically like oh we are not supporting charters or like we want to like they're board basically says that there's some like because your school is specially appro like up for like lease is up for renwell in twenty twenty nine and they are like ok now we don't want to do that like you basically have spent the money on a land which you don't even continue so so that is the biggest risk around that but like that is the path which if you figure out like a long term like renewal of your lease alongside this for the next twenty twenty five years then this path becomes easy like a better solution right then you don't have to spend like full whatever x thousand or x million dollars to buy this versus like just do the additional construction right right now so when you said you know sometimes color school's fund would fund like operating costs would that be something where we could maybe you know request from you funding to support like attorney fees to help us work through or would you want to like how restrictive or so again like for us like we provide grants like once we have done our diligence and there is clarity on the growth path so but what you are saying is like a step before that in terms of like like you have to figure out the growth path before that so so on that like those are the grants that we don't like we typically do it like once the growth grants and then then it's on school on how they want to utilize it like they want to use it for an attorney or facilities or just first three years of startup capital sure but i think in your case what you're saying is like engaging the attorney up front to figure out a growth path yeah yeah yeah so i yeah yeah okay well would you want me to i don't know if it's helpful or not but to send that kind of five year budget narrative yeah if you can share the five year budget and then i will look up the academics like the the framework that we use on the academic side so yeah just reviewing those two things would be unhelpful indication for us to again we do like a more detailed diligence process once we engage and like but at least like this would be a good way to for us to understand like to move to that step but again like as i said like facilities would be the biggest like understanding that would be critical before we move forward so yeah for sure and i do also have the presentation that we did to the district where it included our kind of our community buy in and what parents were saying is that something i guess you would want to see that down the road or yeah at some point yeah once we once like there is paths to grow then we do like more detailed diligence process would love to see that okay cool yeah i think i think yeah let's let's as the next steps like share that information i'll dig into the academics and then depending on your internal conversation around the facilities path like we can probably reconnect in a few weeks if that works yeah that sounds great okay cool so yeah let's stay in touch anything else i can be helpful but no i think that sounds good i will talk with the others and then yeah we'll follow up okay sounds good thanks for your time",

like fundraising or or through philanthropic organization like that can also go on top of that like if there is if there is like not much of a gap between what they are asking and what you can afford like then that gap can be raised through and i know we don't directly do capital grants for facilities we typically do like more operating grants for the school and these are like limited like for for two to three years like similarly hierarchies we are only supporting for like first three years because it's more of a startup expansion phase and that is when you people need more operating surplus but ongoing basis like we we don't provide capital funding but there are few other foundations that we work with that we know do capital giving as well so so like yeah depending on like but again it totally depends on how much is that gap between what's the skin price and what you can afford because all the foundations also has certain limits on on like how much they can give so so that is what would be helpful to understand like if if you go that route is is what i make sense thinking but otherwise i can share a quickly like little bit about colorado schools fund how we work with with schools so we started last year we launched this fund last year so it's been year and a half now since we have been in existence our goal is like three like we work with schools with like three main aspects one is like we look at schools that are serving either historically underserved students like more low income families or students of color or like high special needs student population or or like places like park county where there there are not like you said like when we were first driving to hierarchies the starting of park county to where their location is it was like almost sixty five minute drive so i was like okay this and that on a good day i was coming from denver yeah yeah so we are like sixty five miles the other direction from where high rise well the the other side of more on the summer got it it doesn't have a hospital oh wow so so yeah i think like that looking at that spread of like one school to serve like hour and a half to two hours kind of drive is is just so that is where like we work with schools of like our our schools providing access to families where they don't have other good options or so so that is that is like first bucket the second bucket is like we look at the school quality like how schools are serving the students on basis on their academic performance and then we also understand like each school is serving a different student population so there is context so we kind of use some of the we work with a couple of consultants who help us like contextualize the the data in terms of the student population that that schools are serving and then the last thing is more about like the community need which is like we don't want like schools from outside to just come and say that hey we will serve this community it's more like does the community really need this and is there enough parent demand to do that so those are the three big buckets of schools that we work with now how we support schools is basically so we work with new and expanding schools so new schools like hierarchies launched this year so we we support those so so far like in the last one and a half year we have supported nine schools both i think half of them are new schools and half of them are expansion and then for expansion we typically work with schools that are adding it at least one hundred new students and and how we support is basically provide them like a limited time grant like multi year grant because a lot of new schools like as they are ramping up their enrollment there is a startup capital need so that is what we typically provide but it is generally it is a general operating grant so like if schools already like expanding schools generally have some cash reserves so they don't need the startup funding so they some of them basically use it to put towards facilities it's flexible but as long as like it's it's knowing that it is only for the limited time and like not the ongoing funding is how we is how we support yeah so so that's like the high level of like how we work with schools yeah oh great well and i feel like we kind of fit all of those buckets so one question i had related to that like when you said expansion like how many new seats or like new students based on let's say one hundred fifty two was your twenty twenty five enrollment like how many new students you would be serving so the five year plan i'm trying to see i think what we were thinking is we could eventually get to about two hundred eighty so we're looking to add about a hundred students over the next i mean i guess i should say really even four years so getting close to three hundred students k through twelve three hundred student okay got it i think i think from from like if that is the growth plan to get to one hundred fifty students i think that that kind of fits that framework but i think like the biggest question to that would be just the paths to growth in terms of like i think in your case it's the facilities that's the biggest barrier to growth and then i'll also have to do like some little bit of like digging into the data to understand the academic performance and how we look at it but curious on like the the facilities pathway because like our grant typically doesn't solve for what what your need is so i'm just curious alternate ways to work around the district because if they are the roadblock and they're like one like because they own the building it doesn't like it's difficult to get financing or so yeah that that's the big question i'm trying to figure out in terms of like how we can work and like go more into the diligence process to understand better just the facilities barrier and the work around that and i wonder and maybe that's something i can have our principal ask our attorneys is if like we can kind of i mean we've been asking for this but like what would that look like you know they don't want to support us doing anything to the facilities kind of like you were saying what is our like what can we afford but what are they like what is what are they willing to kind of like sell the building for yeah i think that that that is a path to to explore is that like in the long term again i would say like that's one of the parts to explore because like owning a building and going for a private date comes at a certain financial risk is that then you will have to meet your enrollment goals to make sure you are able to afford and pay debt so so that's the trade off like so making sure that one like confidence and enrollment in terms of like being able to get to that number that you're budgeting for and then yeah just understanding like one like first question like would they even be open to a sale yeah and then sale though i guess they can right i mean if they own the property they can deny a sales yes yeah they are like yeah i mean then the other option is like i used to work a lot in california and that is this is the similar challenge that most of the schools face there so they had a they had a law by law like schools had to provide district space to charter schools but then like the conditions they used to make it so difficult that like charters were stuck there with like no expansion so that's why like a lot of growing charters preferred using that for only first two three years to prove their enrollment and then move to a private facility which they not directly related to the district but again like finding a new facility like making sure your community you have a community buy in to do that also because again moving places comes at a significant switching cost that and then yeah just the pricing of it i think those are the three big questions to kind of figure out one other big component too is we're on the teller and park county line i mean we're like a mile and or maybe two miles from that line so a lot of our students are actually in tiller county ok it's kind of a unique area in that sense whereas like if we got locations if we go too far west i don't know that we would keep i don't think we'd have as much community buy in so we want to stay close to where and then the last alternate path which i'm not sure i'm just thinking about is that if you stay in this space current conditions and if you do like what district allow for like additional like putting more modulars or putting more additional construction there so they can own this space the only challenge there would be that you would be spending your like school will be spending their capital to build that space which we don't get anything out of it yeah yeah yeah so like if two years three years down the line district is basically like oh we are not supporting charters or like we want to like they're board basically says that there's some like because your school is specially appro like up for like lease is up for renwell in twenty twenty nine and they are like ok now we don't want to do that like you basically have spent the money on a land which you don't even continue so so that is the biggest risk around that but like that is the path which if you figure out like a long term like renewal of your lease alongside this for the next twenty twenty five years then this path becomes easy like a better solution right then you don't have to spend like full whatever x thousand or x million dollars to buy this versus like just do the additional construction right right now so when you said you know sometimes color school's fund would fund like operating costs would that be something where we could maybe you know request from you funding to support like attorney fees to help us work through or would you want to like how restrictive or so again like for us like we provide grants like once we have done our diligence and there is clarity on the growth path so but what you are saying is like a step before that in terms of like like you have to figure out the growth path before that so so on that like those are the grants that we don't like we typically do it like once the growth grants and then then it's on school on how they want to utilize it like they want to use it for an attorney or facilities or just first three years of startup capital sure but i think in your case what you're saying is like engaging the attorney up front to figure out a growth path yeah yeah yeah so i yeah yeah okay well would you want me to i don't know if it's helpful or not but to send that kind of five year budget narrative yeah if you can share the five year budget and then i will look up the academics like the the framework that we use on the academic side so yeah just reviewing those two things would be unhelpful indication for us to again we do like a more detailed diligence process once we engage and like but at least like this would be a good way to for us to understand like to move to that step but again like as i said like facilities would be the biggest like understanding that would be critical before we move forward so yeah for sure and i do also have the presentation that we did to the district where it included our kind of our community buy in and what parents were saying is that something i guess you would want to see that down the road or yeah at some point yeah once we once like there is paths to grow then we do like more detailed diligence process would love to see that okay cool yeah i think i think yeah let's let's as the next steps like share that information i'll dig into the academics and then depending on your internal conversation around the facilities path like we can probably reconnect in a few weeks if that works yeah that sounds great okay cool so yeah let's stay in touch anything else i can be helpful but no i think that sounds good i will talk with the others and then yeah we'll follow up okay sounds good thanks for your time yeah thank you appreciate it excellent",

was his first time to get flu so he was also trying to understand how to navigate that yeah i know you briefly mentioned in that email about the expansion or the charter expansion that you all are working on would love to learn more about that and then also happy to talk through colorado schools fund how we work with schools and the supports that we provide great like looked at your website a little bit more and i see that you're working with the rocky mountain outdoor school in fair play yeah hierarchies community school yeah sorry so that was interesting because they got released from the district we're authorized by parker two and our renewal is up next year so the twenty twenty six and i guess a little background we've been trying to do this expansion since about twenty twenty two and they've had we're now on the third superintendent since that time originally at one point cindy berg did approve us to do the best grant but things kind of fell through on our end because we had a different administrator and we just weren't prepared but with the current so last august so i've been with the school since twenty eighteen i guess i should go back i started in twenty eighteen as a fifth grade teacher and then i started working with our secondary program and then wanted to start working in kind of building that because we used to only have about ten to fifteen kids in sixth through eighth grade and so in twenty twenty two the twenty two twenty three school year we actually split out so that was a mixed stage group we split out six seven eight tab individual grades which was great but we started running out of space because we were only k through eight so i was teaching science and social studies and using one room the next year we rolled up so those eighth graders became ninth graders and so we had high school and so we've added about fifteen students each year since then and we were able to get some modulars so we have four classrooms but right now between middle school high school we have about seventy students and essentially five and a half classroom spaces five to six so we're really running out of space here and so last year at the beginning of school year the board our treasurer and myself we did a presentation to the school district asking for their support basically just to sign off on the best grants so that we could do an addition to our school and they cut us off mid presentation and said they're just not going to talk to us anymore about it if we want to we can have lawyers discuss it but they're not going to support it because they're worried that we won't be able to have enough enrollment to support it but we've been increasing our per pupil count like every year and theirs is actually declining when they take out our enrollment so it's kind of weird i don't know why we're like an hour drive from fair play right our students won't go to their school they'll go to woodland park or cripple creek or home school so it's a weird fight that we're in right now so we're trying to see like they won't even give us so we added this expansion into all our documents for the renewal process but they said they won't honor that like we can do amendments but they're not even going to look at it until like next like until the spring and so then that puts us another year behind on the best grant and you know we don't really have any collateral or assets because technically they own the building so it's just it's a weird it's a weird system right now and we just haven't had a very positive relationship with park re two so just a couple of questions so right now i was looking at and correct me if i'm looking at the wrong data but so yours is a pre k through twelve school and based on the last year's enrollment data that we have it was one hundred fifty two full students that you had across pre k twelve okay and then you said that for expansion especially in middle and high school grades because like yeah your fourth grade is almost nineteen students but then it drops because of the space constraints maybe this is dropping from there we have kind of two i think it was kind of covid and other things we had some dips in enrollment so some of our elementary classes have been smaller got it but the idea is we kind of always the goal has been elementary classrooms could be twenty students and then looking at maybe even high school going up to twenty five but we definitely like the small class size feel got it and then from the district engagement perspective so for this expansion like do you need a charter amendment like is there a restriction on number of total number of students and will the expansion require you to go through an amendment of your charter so i mean they've approved us to have high school okay we say it's okay that we can do use the modulars but we're really limited right now we don't have a twelveth grade class and there's only five students in our eleventh grade but as each grade goes up that's going to increase so we can combine ten and eleventh grade for certain classes you know we can combine high school for different electives but we're getting to a point where i don't know if we can serve the students where we're at and for us to secure any sort of funding to build an addition or another building as of right now with our charter agreement we have to get their permission okay so for any additional expansion either not if not necessarily the charter amendment but at least from the district space or like facilities construction space like you will require there okay and the hold up from like or like the pushback from their side is that they're worried about their enrollment going down and like that is that or like is that the cost of this new construction is that the limiting factor that i think the word will fail and that they will be left with an unfinished like construction project or like a school building that they have to fill and they can't got it okay that's my guess that's the best guess i have for it i suppose part of it could be they just are overwhelmed with running their schools and they just don't have time for us and they just don't want to deal with it as i think part of it but yeah because so one thing from like the situation what i'm understanding is because like you don't own the space and like doing anything or like bringing any any capital construction like for construction or addition into this like most of like if i look at the sources of like if this comes through some kind of a low cost loan like the the difficulty is that since you don't own the land like it is difficult for lenders to underwrite it to basically say that what's the yeah and then like for grants like even for the grants like based on what i know like the foundations that i know that do this kind of work i think for them is there is your lease is your lease like a long term lease with thirty i would say it's a thirty year and i think it actually comes up it's not even a lease we don't it's because they used to best grant in i think it was like ninety something to build it so i think the agreements with best and the school district and i think it's up in twenty twenty nine okay and i i don't think there's much due on it because i think originally there was like a mill levy or something like that that paid for it so we don't pay anything to the district to use this space and to my knowledge they don't charge us anything and they're not paying anything to like the state or anything like i think it's actually paid for that's one thing we've been trying to work with like lawyers to even find what would it cost for us to buy the building and the property that we're on so that we could just go on and then maybe secure funding or something along those lines got it we would need we're kind of in the chicken egg where it's like if we find out what it costs like right now with our current charter agreement we'd still need they would have to be willing to like negotiate the sale of the property right and i that's more legal stuff than i than is my yeah so even even if you like so there are more cases of like district buying it from charters that i know versus like the other way like in this case the charter school would have to go through this process but even before like thinking about that like i'm just curious like based on your financials like do you have capacity to finance this purchase because so i know like typically like the schools that we work with except for hierarchies and some of the other you know more innovative schools like typically schools that we work with have like three hundred fifty to four hundred student enrollment so for them like they have like ten to twenty ten to twelve percent of their revenue goes towards facilities lease or dead service so they have that budgeted for and that's how they operate so i'm just curious because you're not paying any signal like lease maybe some facilities operating that you're paying but like if you're not paying so is there capacity in your budget to kind of finance if like that's enough yep capacity in the sense of you know we were paying rent or were we releasing our modulars and we did just actually secure a loan to purchase them outright and then we'll have that as one asset where we could you know sell and use those as you know you know some funding sources as well and we have worked with because we started working with i can't think of his name right now someone who was talking about if we were in good standing with a bank and everything along those lines so we can get letters of like support for our project to get some support and we do have a five year budget plan and i had pulled it up and there is in that plan maybe i could just send that to you even but there are business manager has been building in some capital reserves essentially to go towards this expansion project okay so we don't have a huge it's not huge right now and that's where we're at we're just trying to find we can run a tight budget because you know we've been paying i suppose one thing we're looking at is if we did move to csi you know the district does charge us the full five percent of our flow through from state funding if we went to csi technically we would have you know five percent of our annual revenue would be coming back that we could have to put into the capital construction yeah my guess is like csi also has some admin fee but yeah that will still be net positive for for you all okay because that is what i'm wondering like smaller schools especially around one hundred fifty two hundred student enrollment like owning their own facility i've seen very few examples of that that's why i was asking of like is there enough margin to to do that more where it's like a rent or a lease yeah typically it has been a lease or a rent or like even if they like in case they own like it's it's much like below market or like reduced cost purchase especially in current market like the the real estate prices are high so depending on so typically what we the schools that we work with we suggest that like you look at your budget and see what's the maximum you can pay annually and use that number to figure out that hey this is the maximum purchase price that we can go to because like let's say like let again just for purpose of this i haven't seen the budget but like let's say if they say that you can afford one hundred thousand dollars a year to pay for lease or debt service so instead of so if if that is the case then you can basically say that if you have to take like a twenty five year loan on that and pay one hundred k every year what would it like how much how much you can borrow right so that basically is like you're ask like price that you would you can maximum pay now if district has an incentive to sell it to you or like if if they basically are like heavier selling like if they don't want to sell below market or if that doesn't work for them i think that would be a tricky situation so but like at least the starting point is to understand like your own affordability and start those conversations but then again like so that is that that will give you the the minimum that you can or like the but then there are other sources like if you have like if you raise capital through like fundraising or or through philanthropic organization like that can also go on top of that like if there is if there is like not much of a gap between what they are asking and what you can afford like then that gap can be raised through and i know we don't directly do capital grants for facilities we typically do like more operating grants for the school and these are like limited like for for two to three years like similarly hierarchies we are only supporting for like first three years because it's more of a startup expansion phase and that is when you people need more operating surplus but ongoing basis like we we don't provide capital funding but there are few other foundations that we work with that we know do capital giving as well so so like yeah depending on like but again it totally depends on how much is that gap between what's the skin price and what you can afford because all the foundations also has certain limits on on like how much they can give so so that is what would be helpful to understand like if if you go that route is is what i make sense thinking but otherwise i can share a quickly like little bit about colorado schools fund how we work with with schools so we started last year we launched this fund last year so it's been year and a half now since we have been in existence our goal is like three like we work with schools with like three main aspects one is like we look at schools that are serving either historically underserved students like more low income families or students of color or like high special needs student population or or like places like park county where there there are not like you said like when we were first driving to hierarchies the starting of park county to where their location is it was like almost sixty five minute drive so i was like okay this and that on a good day i was coming from denver yeah yeah so we are like sixty five miles the other direction from where high rise well the the other side of more on the summer got it it doesn't have a hospital oh wow so so yeah i think like that looking at that spread of like one school to serve like hour and a half to two hours kind of drive is is just so that is where like we work with schools of like our our schools providing access to families where they don't have other good options or so so that is that is like first bucket the second bucket is like we look at the school quality like how schools are serving the students on basis on their academic performance and then we also understand like each school is serving a different student population so there is context so we kind of use some of the we work with a couple of consultants who help us like contextualize the the data in terms of the student population that that schools are serving and then the last thing is more about like the community need which is like we don't want like schools from outside to just come and say that hey we will serve this community it's more like does the community really need this and is there enough parent demand to do that so those are the three big buckets of schools that we work with now how we support schools is basically so we work with new and expanding schools so new schools like hierarchies launched this year so we we support those so so far like in the last one and a half year we have supported nine schools both i think half of them are new schools and half of them are expansion and then for expansion we typically work with schools that are adding it at least one hundred new students and and how we support is basically provide them like a limited time grant like multi year grant because a lot of new schools like as they are ramping up their enrollment there is a startup capital need so that is what we typically provide but it is generally it is a general operating grant so like if schools already like expanding schools generally have some cash reserves so they don't need the startup funding so they some of them basically use it to put towards facilities it's flexible but as long as like it's it's knowing that it is only for the limited time and like not the ongoing funding is how we is how we support yeah so so that's like the high level of like how we work with schools yeah oh great well and i feel like we kind of fit all of those buckets so one question i had related to that like when you said expansion like how many new seats or like new students based on let's say one hundred fifty two was your twenty twenty five enrollment like how many new students you would be serving so the five year plan i'm trying to see i think what we were thinking is we could eventually get to about two hundred eighty so we're looking to add about a hundred students over the next i mean i guess i should say really even four years so getting close to three hundred students k through twelve three hundred student okay got it i think i think from from like if that is the growth plan to get to one hundred fifty students i think that that kind of fits that framework but i think like the biggest question to that would be just the paths to growth in terms of like i think in your case it's the facilities that's the biggest barrier to growth and then i'll also have to do like some little bit of like digging into the data to understand the academic performance and how we look at it but curious on like the the facilities pathway because like our grant typically doesn't solve for what what your need is so i'm just curious alternate ways to work around the district because if they are the roadblock and they're like one like because they own the building it doesn't like it's difficult to get financing or so yeah that that's the big question i'm trying to figure out in terms of like how we can work and like go more into the diligence process to understand better just the facilities barrier and the work around that and i wonder and maybe that's something i can have our principal ask our attorneys is if like we can kind of i mean we've been asking for this but like what would that look like you know they don't want to support us doing anything to the facilities kind of like you were saying what is our like what can we afford but what are they like what is what are they willing to kind of like sell the building for yeah i think that that that is a path to to explore is that like in the long term again i would say like that's one of the parts to explore because like owning a building and going for a private date comes at a certain financial risk is that then you will have to meet your enrollment goals to make sure you are able to afford and pay debt so so that's the trade off like so making sure that one like confidence and enrollment in terms of like being able to get to that number that you're budgeting for and then yeah just understanding like one like first question like would they even be open to a sale yeah and then sale though i guess they can right i mean if they own the property they can deny a sales yes yeah they are like yeah i mean then the other option is like i used to work a lot in california and that is this is the similar challenge that most of the schools face there so they had a they had a law by law like schools had to provide district space to charter schools but then like the conditions they used to make it so difficult that like charters were stuck there with like no expansion so that's why like a lot of growing charters preferred using that for only first two three years to prove their enrollment and then move to a private facility which they not directly related to the district but again like finding a new facility like making sure your community you have a community buy in to do that also because again moving places comes at a significant switching cost that and then yeah just the pricing of it i think those are the three big questions to kind of figure out one other big component too is we're on the teller and park county line i mean we're like a mile and or maybe two miles from that line so a lot of our students are actually in tiller county ok it's kind of a unique area in that sense whereas like if we got locations if we go too far west i don't know that we would keep i don't think we'd have as much community buy in so we want to stay close to where and then the last alternate path which i'm not sure i'm just thinking about is that if you stay in this space current conditions and if you do like what district allow for like additional like putting more modulars or putting more additional construction there so they can own this space the only challenge there would be that you would be spending your like school will be spending their capital to build that space which we don't get anything out of it yeah yeah yeah so like if two years three years down the line district is basically like oh we are not supporting charters or like we want to like they're board basically says that there's some like because your school is specially appro like up for like lease is up for renwell in twenty twenty nine and they are like ok now we don't want to do that like you basically have spent the money on a land which you don't even continue so so that is the biggest risk around that but like that is the path which if you figure out like a long term like renewal of your lease alongside this for the next twenty twenty five years then this path becomes easy like a better solution right then you don't have to spend like full whatever x thousand or x million dollars to buy this versus like just do the additional construction right right now so when you said you know sometimes color school's fund would fund like operating costs would that be something where we could maybe you know request from you funding to support like attorney fees to help us work through or would you want to like how restrictive or so again like for us like we provide grants like once we have done our diligence and there is clarity on the growth path so but what you are saying is like a step before that in terms of like like you have to figure out the growth path before that so so on that like those are the grants that we don't like we typically do it like once the growth grants and then then it's on school on how they want to utilize it like they want to use it for an attorney or facilities or just first three years of startup capital sure but i think in your case what you're saying is like engaging the attorney up front to figure out a growth path yeah yeah yeah so i yeah yeah okay well would you want me to i don't know if it's helpful or not but to send that kind of five year budget narrative yeah if you can share the five year budget and then i will look up the academics like the the framework that we use on the academic side so yeah just reviewing those two things would be unhelpful indication for us to again we do like a more detailed diligence process once we engage and like but at least like this would be a good way to for us to understand like to move to that step but again like as i said like facilities would be the biggest like understanding that would be critical before we move forward so yeah for sure and i do also have the presentation that we did to the district where it included our kind of our community buy in and what parents were saying is that something i guess you would want to see that down the road or yeah at some point yeah once we once like there is paths to grow then we do like more detailed diligence process would love to see that okay cool yeah i think i think yeah let's let's as the next steps like share that information i'll dig into the academics and then depending on your internal conversation around the facilities path like we can probably reconnect in a few weeks if that works yeah that sounds great okay cool so yeah let's stay in touch anything else i can be helpful but no i think that sounds good i will talk with the others and then yeah we'll follow up okay sounds good thanks for your time yeah thank you appreciate it excellent",

          "content": "until the elections that's pretty much what everyone is that's the sense i'm getting from everybody this sounds great and let's let's see what happens in november and so i know that lydia and rosemary and anna and i are supposed to be getting something on the calendar for november to like as like okay where are we now now that we know more like what's what's our next step i think that feels separate from what i'm doing or trying to do with tony right so would still like to talk about that but those are those are the kinds of conversations we could hold in a monthly check in so i'm all for it probably helps with your calendars as well but it definitely helps with mine great and just to say allowed mister duncan i talked about if we shift a month to which sounds like we're all on the same page too feel free to reach out at any time if it's helpful to chat in the meantime or if it's helpful for us to look at stuff asynchronously the goal of this is to better match your the time you're spending in meetings to what you're trying to accomplish but like if that comes up and you need eyes that you're not getting or thoughts partnership like just show yeah that's that's great that's great yeah okay well that's that should be fairly easy to kind of shift it's really just like one meeting drops off and we just keep the other one right so yeah okay great that sounds good just on my end too if there's like obviously people call me anytime or if there's like an ad hoc conversation you can always email julie who manages my schedule and just be like does what do you have any guide time in the next to look over here either way that's great yeah i'll take advantage of that more i haven't taken advantage of that at all but julie because it's just it's up until now it's been working to just text and you know either you or i decide yeah this is a phone call let's just hop on the phone yeah yeah yeah that's great i appreciate the just consideration of calendar i mean i know you got you all think about that a lot too and just how do we align that to priorities this is great let's see really quick can i give you if it's okay to move on y just an update on finance sudanshi i just want to give a quick update there made a connection with alpine we're in the process of opening that account i expect it to be open by middle to late next week is what we're shooting for i spoke to ian ian's great they seem awesome they just really they just really get it and because my needs right now are just so basic you know it's it's it'll go really fast right really just setting up two accounts one for csf and the other is just the operating keep everything separate and make it really clean and transparent so that's that's what i'm doing in the process of doing that now they just needed my articles and ein and things like that so i'll be getting that to them today and then waiting for next steps i think there's a form i need to sign things like that okay so that's that's my update there kind of the way i'm thinking about it is like and you pushed on this thinking is i think there's really like three big phases to this right phase one is what i'm in which is there is grant money in this account no co mingling in that account there's an operating piece and then i'm working with shannon shannon's great by the way love her i think clicked very quickly based on her experience she's helping me just set up some of the infrastructure for just payroll so that just to make it clean and kind of automatic for reporting as well again just transparent is what i want and that that'll kick off here pretty soon i guess end of october and then really the only other reason for using operating the operating account would be for the things i'm using it for now which is just i travel or you know paying for consultant support things like that yeah perfect i think yeah shannon is great and then i think you had mentioned about like just keeping accounts clean from get go i think will help next year as you file the five hundred one and all the documentation that would be required so that's good yeah yeah yeah yeah she she i mean there's a lot of things i appreciate about her but one of the big things is oh we should be using these codes now that'll get you really used to like state codes later and just like how do we how do we make things really clear now so that the next phase the next couple of phases are just become building blocks and not we're not having to clean anything up in the future so she is a she is smart she is very experienced and very very skilled so i appreciate the connection awesome let's see here oh along along with that can i can i get a little bit at the information about the we went back and forth a little bit about csgf and some you mentioned there's there's the grant opportunity that you were kind of i got the sense that you were encouraged me to like look into it and so i i just would love to learn more yeah and lydia feel free to share but justin so csgf like every year they have this funding opportunity like if that's more of a cohort model that they have which every october to december they open the application and then go through the process and by june they finalize their investments so they have two tracks there one is the school like schools that are opening next fall and or schools that are replicating or expanding like that is one track and then the other track is just eir program where schools are like at least one and a half two years away from the launch so eir program is basically like they'll give two hundred fifty k funding but then then like the re up of that and like if the school successfully opens and like you meet the milestones like you will call it automatically qualify for fundraising like startup funding for first three to four years so so that is the eir track given like the charter is not approved and you're still working on the application my sense was that eir track would make more sense to apply for now my guess is that it the funding will be contingent upon you getting the charter but by june like their approval and like your charter timeline will will work together so that is something and because they deadline is december i was like if if you have if you can apply now and get into the process that'll be that'll make it easier okay lydia anything else on the csgf front um i don't think so the one thing she can have to i'm just thinking we might want to check in with our team on is whether i think it still makes sense to apply this fall sometimes they're like more likely to approve you the closer you are to opening but i think they're also trying to support more innovative models with experienced leaders and so i think you'll have a really good shot just in but if we could just double check that it says fall that makes the most sense yeah so just i'll just take that they would be silly not to give you the funding in my opinion yeah so justin i'll take the next step on me like i'll just connect with the the c team member who is leading the sourcing and then i'll double check and then put you in touch if you have any questions that sounds great it sounds like if it's a match and it's not too early and this is something they would they would likely support what i'm hearing from you all is encouragement to apply like this is this is a really strong pathway especially because it leads to like no more funding later yeah okay yeah yeah okay so you don't find out until june it's a very long process i think you find out like that you'd be moved on earlier but i think our final sport approval is in june like the final final got it okay great well then i'll hang tight then for now yeah okay let's see here i'd love to just get give y'all an update on the these site visits and kind of like what i'm taking away it's quite a bit you know it's you you all have been many many school visits so this will probably sound familiar it's like you go to some schools and there there are like tidbits that you'll pull out that you're like oh my gosh that is excellent how did that happen and let me try to unpack that and then i'll go to some where it's like i i have to really think so much of the school is excellent like how did this entire thing happen you know it's like it's like a different situation and then like the third bucket is this is being presented as an exemplar and i don't think it is what right like that that is a that is a totally different and so i for those visits i'm kind of just like gracious and supportive and like it's more about the relationship and that sort of thing and luckily there haven't been many in the third bucket you know i think if if i were to boil it down the george washington carver collegiate academies in new orleans i've never been to a school like that before in my life and i've i've run lots of schools i've seen lots of schools and i it was a school visit that really adjusted my bar for excellence in high school and that's that's saying a lot i don't say that lightly because i think i've i've seen and i've run really really good schools that i i would have called excellent and now i think i'm calling them good compared to what i've seen there specifically with culture and just like adult culture and how that translates into well daily action intervention goal setting and student support i would call it overall like the the the two words i'm taking away from that is just this is what radical ownership looks like in a school right and so that that has pushed me to refine even how i think about culture and aliento and really like how does you know that i i want i went there originally because like like so many other people who have gone there it's like how are you catching kids up this fast who are coming that fr behind in the ninth grade that's that's really the reason why i went there and i i learned exactly how and it wasn't exactly what i thought like they certainly have the programs but they also have the the culture that drives the programs which again just seems like very of course it does but it was so visceral that that that has pushed me to kind of refine even how i think about like the pillars and some of and like the narrowing of focus in the programming especially in year one and two of the schools that that that was just that was a good level i could go into more detail there but that was pretty incredible i think comp side was pretty phenomenal i think the i'm sorry lydia go ahead i was just going to say justin you know collegiate academy's founder his name is ben markovitz have you had a chance to do you know him or have you ever chanced to interact with him no no i just i just worked with the cao there the reason i bring it up is that ben is now doing coaching work and all aligned around how do you build mindsets and adults that result in the kind of culture that you saw there and his whole philosophy is that that's where that's the beginning the middle and the end of it is around to be an adult culture where everyone feels like it's their responsibility to grow kids and is feeling accountable to that but in like a positive joyful way and anyway he's fabulous and he's now doing he he's now that's like all he's doing now is like working with other leaders around how to do that and so i can connect you if you're interested in talking to him more and maybe even building a deeper relationship as you're thinking about it instill that that would be great that would be great i spent the day with the cao she's granted we kind of go we realize we had a connection from a long time ago so that was justin that's like how you said that line say that like almost every day it's it's a little ridiculous and humorous at this point where it's like yeah we know each other from this and i'm like oh my in a really good way it's pretty yeah she just i mean they open their entire they just pull the curtain back i spent a lot of time in intervention there spends a lot of time talking to their dean of culture there spend some time talking to kids there i would love to talk to ben that'd be great i don't know him yet but okay cool outside so upside so the instruction at comp sci i thought could be better i didn't think the instrument but you know like every school has a day where they just have five people out and that sort of thing and i think when i heard from several people i wanted you to see this person but they're not here so i think they just had like a lot of subs in things like that and yet the culture was great even with subs i spend a lot of time with kids at that school and i spends a lot of time with their post secondary team at that school i think that's kind of the gem of that school the post secondary team and how they weave collagen career together because it's a bit of a dance and there's a lot of nuance they do it very very well they're more of like a breadth model rather than a depth model but still there is a lot that i just started to think about in terms of like relevant pathways and how does that how does that kind of like push me to refine pathway offerings a little bit differently and they push me on like just didn't push me i push myself based on that conversation just staffing model a bit like just thinking about staffing model what does it take in like a year one to pull something like that off because it wouldn't be i mean they're fully grown so it'd be slightly different obviously and yeah so i took a lot of way about just what is what is like who does what went like how does this actually work in a year one year two scenario with with the team and how do you this has actually come up quite a bit like how do you make this super uber passionate team that is focused on college and career really gets in it how do you how do you like contextualize that mindset and thinking into core academics where most of those folks are like they were never in industry their career educators their k twelve folks they're you know they have like a completely different mindset and a lot of them like how do you connect the two mindsets together and have one culture driving toward the same thing that is that is harder than it sounds like it should be especially in those schools that are just known for these kinds of pathways i spoke to a couple of bio teachers who i thought in my head i was like surely like you could see how your work connects to the pathways especially the science pathways the kids are pursuing and she struggled to explain that you know it was like wow even at a comp side which is like this is what they do that's hard right and so kind of like with collegiate like i keep going back to how important hiring is going to be in in addition to like the infrastructure for the staffing model it's like hiring the right people is just going to be so important and then the third that i wanted to like lift up i should probably just drop this here this might actually be helpful because i'm not going to go through all of it but you might see something that you want to learn more about and it's helpful for me to talk about it because it just helps me process on kind of the external process or in that way this is kind of where i'm keeping broad notes you don't want to see my journal it won't make sense to anyone at barely making sense to me so this is kind of where i'm just trying to capture broad strokes the third one was an recommendation and that was aviation high school in in long island y'all that school is incredible i it's you know ninety year old public school started in like i think something like nineteen twenty five it's crazy oh yeah sure let's see here and let's see and what it had told me like she'd been wanting to see the school for a while but it had been really hard to kind of break in and get a connection all of that i thought it was pretty easy like i just emailed the principal and he was like sure and he like personally walked me around for ninety minutes in that school i saw everything from ninth all the way up this place is like it's six i mean i can't i don't i won't have a school like this like there's there's no way but someday what they can would be incredible i mean it's like a six story two city block school two thousand kids they have a hangar on site they have like full airplanes in this hangar with like kids like inside of the engines like pressure testing wires and things that i don't even understand and then like talking to each other but the way they build it from ninth all the way up you know if if all you saw was the flashy twelfth graders tell me about their you know interviews with america airlines and working on the inside of these engines and that's all you saw it would be impossible for you to say like well how did that happen right you have to go to ninth grade and you have to see what they're working on in ninth grade and you could just see how clearly like they're just building it every year like this was like the best example of depth in pathway programming i've seen what were there student demographics like well they they pull kids from off the pi burrows it's like a it's like a what they call a cte club they have five these hubs there's six of these hubs this one focused on aviation and aerospace you you apply to get in but it's not based on grades or status or anything it's like they can just only offer a certain amount of seats so i think there's like a say involved i'm not sure exactly how that works but they're demographics were i mean they still had twenty five percent emergent bilinguals they still have like i think seven or seventeen there's sixteen or seventeen percent special education most of their kids i think they had it was there only twenty twenty only twenty four percent of their kids in the specific pathways program were female students like a low number but compared to like the other programs he was careful to note that that's actually a pretty high number because like we're just any any female student who says they're interested we pretty much just let them in because we're just trying to make those numbers go as high as possible so there were a lot of like reasons why this like i wouldn't want a school exactly like this right but like the program itself and how they've set that up and how they contextualize it in academics i want to learn more about that but there there is there is a connection there obviously they've had a long long time to make this happen but they still have budget constraints they still had all the same problems that a normal public school has they weren't immune to any of those things but i i guess my my biggest takeaway in programming was just like rap and i think it's well deserved in some cases but the the bad rap of like well cte program is x and that's kind of like this other options and alternative options the only option that you justin can have because of your grades and because of a whole lot of other things this this was like the strongest example of what rigor should look like in high school like just the depth the precision the discipline because every kid in that program is working toward faa certification which i i knew this much before i went there about what that meant and i know a lot more like it is very very very rigorous what it takes so that level of precision and discipline i think also appeals like when you talk about it like that i think that appeals to industry folks like that's the kind of like precision and discipline and like high expectations that are expected to see if they're if they're going to hire someone or hire somebody and put them through college while you're working for them like that's what they expect and i think without knowing that i think k twelve misses that level of rigor like that's what you're working towards this is what you want kids to be able to access you're not going to access that if you have like an aimless curriculum and if you're not building up on that rigor really from day one so i'm kind of going all over the place but it's like push me on mission vision commitment it's pushed me on like the exact pillars like how am i precisely talking about the pillars that i want to offer them and then how does that push me on narrowing offerings that's this is kind of what's been going through my head for the last three weeks awesome here curious is it helping you narrow what your learning agenda is for future visits like what does it implementation for you're trying to figure out for business that are coming up yeah because my other my next two visits coming up are to davinci and domain and i i really have like two kind of essential two essential questions that i that i now want to learn from those two places because i think i do think those two places do this pretty well like i need to learn more about the actual partnerships in not just curriculum but instruction for a lot of these pathways like it was clear to me how aviation high school did it because i do most of it in house but they've had like ninety years to work on that right so it looked like a stumbling block for comp side like i think that was a stumbling block the curriculum connection but also the they had to go outside the school for almost everything which put a lot of weight on the post secondary team like they have to have a robust post secondary team in order to like basically hustle in fact the leader of that team called herself like the chief hustler because they like she she has to like constantly find and and also the liaison that's funny i just made this the liaison for and shoots at act and then dsst aurora school also calls herself like a hustler like these are people who are like if that falls through we got to work with this person so i'm kind of more interested in like well how do you just create a more consistent relationship that's based on like the rigor of the teaching and curriculum in the pathway during the school day whether it's an internship or on campus like how do you do that and i think i think davinci does that better and then the second piece that i'm still struggling to understand how people do this differently is that connection between pathway and core academics and how do they make this like a scene with this connection because that's really the skills mapping idea that i was thinking about like how do you map the durable skills competencies between core academics and industry but also the mindsets of the adults i think those are those are some things those are two things that i'm wanting to learn more about i mean honestly it connects to like in a in a really strange way it connects to george washington our pretty collegiate academics like pretty well i mean it's it's not that different right i mean they're just their context is like intervention acceleration closing gaps and like everyone's a part of that there is radical ownership of everybody every single day on the prize and what i'm saying is that yes and that adult culture and focus has to be applied to more academics and pathway work as well like we are all owning that there is depth and programming so the kids have as many options as they as they can possibly have dustin the i don't know if you're going to have a chance to make it over to elevate hopefully this year sometime in idaho but yeah i think it's on the calendar oh great okay i was just gonna say that's an example of a school where i feel like they integrate the like hooks in the pathway career pathways work really well into the core academics of the school and so that's just one thing that's maybe spend a little bit extra time with them on when you're there how they do the planning with the pathways teachers and the core content teachers together yeah that seems that's great that's that's that's the second thing that i'm trying to learn more about and i'm going to elevate i think beginning of november is what we landed on so and this occurs to me on your second question if when the unity innovation center lands kirsten you like the idea of alex kids accessing dps services adds an additional wrinkle to this right it's like all right what kind of complexity are you introducing in that applications of that for maintaining and sustaining a unified adult culture yes wherever the students are yeah yes that's exactly right yeah i was thinking about that a lot i was like you know in a true collaboration we should be collaborating on culture you know but like by definition unless something's done intentionally by definition those two schools in a similar in the same building are going to have different cultures you know and maybe that's okay right but i think it needs to be named that the closer we didn't align the better i mean i could hear tony tonight tony's just going to be like just take the middle school too because i you know but i i do think that could be that that that is an interesting point and that's something i'm going to have to like think about like if you're ready to switch i mean that's the only other thing that was on my my list was was that was that where the dps work yes they do to the innovations center i i was like i got to call this something that you know but i really did it really did feel like you you don't i mean there are too many data points now that are just like there is no plan and people are like like kind of like low key frustrated about that like the various people are just like this doesn't disservice to the the folks who voted there's a big deal you know and so again my push continues to be like well unless you tell me no like i'm going to keep going right and just you know i think again tony and others and everybody you know just holding their breath for for november and so when they get that meeting on the calendar with you know rosemary and others in november but that the i haven't figured out exactly how i want to leverage the what's it called the kind of like value proposition that and and i don't know i may add more to it but let me just drop that in the chat and in case it's easier to access it there greg thank you for all the comments in it i need to i mostly responded to the comments i'm still digesting them and i haven't really done a lot of work to go back into it this is my like i started to think like if i were tony and i was talking about this or arguing for this what would i need to be armed with in order to have a substantive conversation about this with someone else and so that's where this two pager kind of idea came from it's like this is what i would want if if i wasn't there this is what i would hope that others would say we were talking to like a board member talking to other people and so that's where this came from if there's something else i think like a way especially an opportunity if you see one you know in that you internet proposal like the the seven page proposal if i'm not addressing something else that's a bit of an elephant in the room in that proposal i i want to be able to address that in this value proposition document because the document itself is less important i think this language could be used in a slide deck or talking voice or something like that could be use a variety of ways so the only other thing i'll say is i haven't gotten anything else on tony's calendar but i think i'm going to reach out to his ea and just because that was our last text hey we should get something on the calendar so i'm going to reach out and see if i can't get something on the calendar and then for aps doing the same i've reached out to i think her name is candice to get on giles's calendar i have a feeling that both people are going to push me to like let's meet november which is fine like just tell me tell me no then tell me to pause tell me to stop and it might charter application thinking and planning i'm just i'm still i'm just still planning for both dps and aps at this point i thought this was really helpful and like i like how concise it is my concrete and two of arching costs one of which i alluded to in my email back to you justin but with one was and it's a i was like maybe we just don't know exactly yet but exactly what you were just saying i think it it seemed like sort of tweaks to what you've captured here and how it translates to a deck really depends on like all right who is the ultimate audience going to be and what do they need to hear like what are they and so i just wonder next time next time you do get a chance with tony if it makes sense to just ask that if the rest of the conversation is flowing along the path of course next steps of just asking the question directly but like if i'm going to hit four what if what is for audience x what is my what do they need to hear and i didn't have enough of a lens on who the audience would be or if we're thinking about general dps if there's stuff missing here but it might be just worth asking folks directly as you interact with them then the second thought which feels very down the road but it's just occurring to me as i'm reading this is i find this idea very exciting also has complexity super important to be successful in year one and so just like thinking through as as this idea is evolving all right what does this mean i need to be really good at in year one and am i still sort of defining a manageable set of things that i'm going to be able to nail into year one and then are there like that caveat maybe not the right word but like if this stuff that you're worried about like might take building boards are there with ways to sort of signal that early so that expertise are aligned so i was trying to read it with that lens and so just naming it as a i'm sure you're thinking about that but just like i think it's easy as we get down the sort of idea and sort of communicate with dps pathway to get a bunch on there and i think supporting occasionally revisit it they're like all right is there anything on here i feel like it's gonna be really hard to execute in your own thoughts yeah i love it like one thing that comes to mind you know that the complexity of the like the shared cross enrollment idea i don't i don't know and this is maybe something i would need to write somewhere i don't know that that's something that we would even leverage until probably year two right because the reason why a student from dps another school would want to leverage a pathway with us would be that's a specific pathway that goes into the right level of depth and i want to access that well we're we're not going to offer something like that until a year or two right until there's sophomores i mean in year one it's going to be three things it's going to be it's going to be culture it's going to be rigor and academics that the intervention specifically and it's going to be identity work that's it that's really it i mean without the identity work students are co designing and thinking about how their passions and their purpose align right so that's that is critical the culture when i mean by that is similar to what we've been talking about this call like the old culture and the culture of these pathways and how they're integrated i think that is going to be probably priority number one and then of course the academics the intervention quite frankly like catching kids up otherwise none of this matters if they're not caught up quickly none of this matters if it's not connected to who they are it doesn't matter it's just a normal school like any other and if the culture isn't there then this isn't different either so those are like the three things that we have to nail and they're kind of all venn diagram they kind of all you know connect together so it just it none of that is really sexy to be honest it might be i think it is i think it is right but if you look on the surface it's like well how is that innovative it's like it's incredibly innovative not a lot of schools do that well yeah so that makes a ton of sense and this is i think a little carp before the horse but i think the question is just as you get as you start having conversations with more of tony and green lights you'd be talking to a lot of folks are there any of those expectation management things that you just named that are important to try to be explicit about so you don't get to a place where someone's like wait a minute like i thought you were bringing in a bunch of dbs students who aren't in atlanta and you're want and then people i think down the road but just wanted to name it as think about as yeah your push is great generally on managing people's expectations are helpful so yeah thank you i was just gonna add two more quick thoughts on this and justin i think the document's awesome you know the what strikes me whether this is gonna work or not mvps is obviously politics which we have no control over but then the excitement around the vision and the meeting the unmet need and the second is you justin and so i actually i know this is not your nature but i think we need to like even on this talk about the work that you've been doing in ddps and with dps in the relational trust in the fact that you believe in dps winning and that's part of the difference in the third way approach that you're coming at this with and then i would go a little punch even a little stronger on the first chunk on vision from like an aspirational here's what's possible for our young people to like truly deliver like you now have that vision of that aviation school and it's like we don't have anything like this in denver okay bring that energy into the okay and related to that point justin i was thinking and the context that you shared about like hey ear what like this is the focus and like we are not talking about like hey industry and internships and like all those pieces like that is you'll start those conversations but like but just in this piece and to the point that lydia made about like aviation and like highlighting that i was just wondering like if there are like one or two partners who can stamp this or like industry partners who can stamp this which increases the weight in conversations with dps is that boeing said this or like going is aligned on this so like just those pieces of like if if not a formal partnership at least the their codes around the need part yeah yeah yeah even like as a quote in that two pager no as in like just generally i think you had highlighted right like the why aerospace and why now but yeah where you have quoted like what their projections are but like just making it more personal in terms of like hey they're head of dia or denver airport said diet or like again you are having those conversations i was just wondering like if they have shared like same need or same yeah they usually go a step further you know yeah bill usually goes separately like for an example i'll say you know like like deborah wilcox or something but because she's the chair for the colorado aerospace business roundtable her name comes up a lot and as she's very enthusiastic about this work she was just kind of one upping me the entire conversation like i would say well this statistic seems like this would be necessary she's like oh no it's greater than that there's a huge need and she would talk about like average age of you know an aerospace engineer is x and so yeah i think you're right and yeah it was just your feedback is like how do you punch this up right bunch this up and then just showing this plan as an endorsement from the industry yeah kind of creates more impact on your industry partnership vision yeah there's about to be a lot more of that happening this month with chris chavez so this is yeah i need to be gathering that in these conversations that would be easy to do love it okay great gosh i don't know how i think we're almost in time again let's see here the rest of the things i have on my list are more just like updates i think the main things we were able to get to yeah no one thing on the charter application stuff which yes you you all already gone back and forth on and i'm sure you've already on your radar justin but just naming that for each of the processes there's like a first step of either reaching out to somebody or attending trainings and all the websites have like the moment that the the updated timeline is going to be up there and all that kind of stuff probably already on your radar but just worth checking at some point again to make sure you know what the first step is in each place and when you want to do it like on dps's website for example it says you should reach out to the authorizing team if you're interested and it gives their email so now to jump in here if you have a point of view i'm not sure about the right timing is to do that like i think i might wait until after you've gotten some traction with tony to do that or whoever else but like just naming that there is that step so make sure you know what that step is in each place and can think about that all right when do i need to pull the trigger on that that's a really good point for aps it's really really fuzzy yeah i think for dps still fuzzy but again the criteria for the application is senior leadership co signing on this idea and there's a facility involved like ddps from a little bit more aligned with that with dps than with aps my sense with aps is that they are overwhelmed and they're already thinking about this comprehensive high school and dss t commingling is a facility even on the table i have no idea i have no idea part of me wonders if it is so what you're saying is just like take those start dates and take this like first steps into account with the plan yeah and just to name a lot my word is just there's always a risk in any of these things that you miss sort of a bureaucratic milestone right and then get into a reactive mode so just like and that is a make sure you're starting the processes at the appropriate time is a good way to make sure you're not missing us so that's all it's not a huge deal i just want to make sure there are no and just to note i was thinking like when you speak to alyssa like talk about them project managing some of these steps so that they are keeping a tab of all these key milestones or timelines that you need to meet in terms of submitting the charter okay great okay what am i forgetting i had one completely different question for you justin answer today but just to kind of put on your radar that i've been thinking about i'm wondering if the second half of this year is a good time to test anything that you've been wondering about or if you're thinking about doing that next fall but situanch and i were at a school that just opened this fall there's a very different model this week and they had the opportunity to really test for like a long period of time last year and learn so much that informed the ultimate model and it just it just made me think about that question for you and i feel like we have a lot of good partners who might be open to allowing you to do something you know what pieces of the model the ones you feel most that need to do that but just encourage you to think about that next twelve month period yeah i had originally planned to just even test some of the model ideas with like a group of kids just you know even yeah that's what i mean okay let me think about that some more okay and that might be like a summer like maybe that's like a next summer thing like it's summer program you can offer or you know anyway i think it'll come to you once you figure out what pieces of it are the ones that that you yeah i can tell you the first thing that comes to mind is even just testing what that agenda should be for the like summer bridge going into ninth grade i mean that that's something that people do very differently from place to place and that is that is something that i would probably test and i think we tested in the summer yeah that's good thank you i'm adding publicity here which may be the wrong idea but love that testing idea and presumably it's government getting traction on the unity idea summer you could test the summer bridge with dps in some ways and that might be a way to get really concrete collaboration on something the student centered early so that might make it harder to execute but might have some real dividends and building relationships and getting traction yeah justin sorry i love that craig last thought on this because i think i was supposed to introduce you to ann peakey at aps two which i can do if you want to meet with her it'll probably she'll probably want to wait till after the board election because she's running for reelection and it's crazy so i might honestly it may make sense to just wait a few weeks i think to make that introduction i think it's going to be highly unlikely aps is going to give you district space for this i just don't think it fits cleanly enough into their current plans and they're like a little wedded to their current plans right now the only other wondering i have is whether it's following back up with twenty seven j which who told me explicitly that they're going to have extra space in one of their high schools that's ten minutes from the airport just as like another i don't i'm like wary of like giving you too many political paths to try to start working on but at the same time i feel like it's like applying to college like we need a safety school you know i agree so anyway maybe think about that a little bit but that just might be one other something else worth thinking about do you think that's something that we should i keep thinking about this like kind of circling the wagons meeting in november that we were on that text thread about with rosemary is that something we bring into a conversation like that just like what are the what's the a path the beep have or is that a different conversation because i agree with you it's everything feels tenuous right and obviously it'll be more clear in november but it's not it's not a great strategy you just have to like this this unity proposal that i threw together for them like that's the path that feels very tenuous yeah i mean it feels pretty clear in my mind i don't know greg i respond to if you have thoughts that that the dps path is like by far the best one if we could figure it out for a myriad of reasons from the fact that that really is the airport district and like as you deep in partnerships there like that just as logical it makes sense they have this plan they don't have a plan they have the money the building they have the plan like there's just you have the relationship like i think ninety five percent of your energy honestly should be going on the dps route and that will include like the second we know who gets elected to the far northeast school board district you we want to make sure you're meeting with them you know all the all those things and so i think it might be maybe maybe as i'm talking it through maybe we just wait until i don't think we need to hash that out in the conversation with rosary but you and i could just get on the phone the day after the elections justin and be like okay well what does this do for game plan and then and then we could we can fire on the safety school twenty seven j introduction sounds good do you have it does that sound does that sound right to you yeah i think that all sounds right and justin the thing i'd be curious about honestly is given your relationship with tony like at what point is there a point in which you feel like you're getting a clear read from him on his like his confidence on the path because i like i think in my head that's a big part of like your relationship is a big part of why the dps path feels promising yeah it's really the only reason why this feels promising yeah so like i think it's worth just saying out loud like yeah like is there a point at which you you will know that you're getting a sort of ambiguous signal from tony and so because like he's and it's probably post election but just naming our label like testing with tony feels like a big gateway for increasing decreasing confidence and then yeah lydia the only thing i'd add to your point is it might be worth just looking quickly at twenty seven j timelines which i don't think is probably at all urgent but like the election hubbling after the election makes sense and then knowing all right if we do go the safety route what vvc be true by when in order to feel like we're kind of out passing yeah yeah i i mean from what i know about tony which it's turning out to be like actually i know a lot about somebody because it's been pretty accurate so far he's a pretty straight shooter type of person like he he doesn't like to kind of beat around the bush and so the positive signals that i'm getting from him like i trust those signals he would not be saying i mean he would just tell me like there's not a shot in hell just like just hold on he would tell me that you know i think you also there's like an inference that i'm making too that he and i both understand that he doesn't make those decision the board makes this decision so so much of it just really depends on what happens in the next couple of weeks yeah i mean it's it's making me think you know i i'm gonna reach out again to his ea i'll just text him and say hey like just follow me because in the last text thread we had it was like i think we need another meeting tony to just like talk about this and he was like yeah thumbs up so i think i'm just gonna follow up with like does it make sense for us to get together in the next couple of weeks or do you want to wait until november to to get together and talk about this some more in the meantime i have a two pager i'm working on to help any of us with language on how to like like position this isn't in a value proposition way i'm happy to send that to you just tell me what tell me what you think i'm does that i think this fish is the way you just described but you know tony adele but like i do think it would be a mistake to do any like push any false urgency if he's like wait so i'm not starting it needs to like rush it past like with whatever his pace it feels appropriate but just naming like you'll get a clear signal at some points here and then that will be really helpful and indicating great okay and lydia you mentioned when you talk to twenty seven j before if i remember correctly it was kind of like they were sort of like we've got this space but i think your read was like they both they don't know what they want or they're sophisticated kindly so yeah yeah we'd have to like really like walk through you know yes here's what this could look like etcetera justin the last thing how are you feeling about like actual family and student interest in the model yeah i've i i'm scheduled to have a meeting with families in early november i have a connection with the elk community center they do a lot of work with denver families just in engagement with families in the far north east i'm actually meeting with them next week it looks like next week i had my first meeting with them they've been very open to just like having family meetings there my my sense from folks i've been talking to matthew and then griselda this place is like it seems like a no brainer that families want this opportunity and it seems like it feels ironic to them that they see in the news that people complain about talent and they're like well we don't have access to that i i want i want feedback on the actual model itself right my worry and the one thing that i think is going to come up is this isn't a comprehensive high school model you know and so there is like you know families do want like some basic things out of high school they want safety they want strong academics and things like that but i'm also hearing that they you know what sports do we offer and things like that that can comprehensive high school would would offer and so i think there's going to be a i think there's going to be a sticking point there but i want to get more like of those trans meetings off the ground yeah and and i think justin has right to think about input into the model but i also think it's important to put on your like recruitment hat yeah like for this charter application to be approved and also for you to like have confidence that you're launching this school like you need to know that there are kids who are going to be signed up to you know who right now are seventh graders who are going to be your students right and start building that base of like literally thinking of it like a letters of intent how how are we tracking towards progress you probably already think about this but still offset like but but as you're starting this conversation i think it's worth trying to come out with all those conversations with list of names of the folks who were there and contact information but similar to sinatra's industry point like capture the quotes that you hear along the way because i'm sure those are going to be usable and then delete the letters of intent as appropriate but it's worth using every single family interaction i think with that recruitment hat on to build list of potential interested families good to see you as well sorry justin i feel like we were like just throwing a lot at you but super excited about where you are and all the all the inspiration you're taking from the schools that you've been visiting too it's awesome this is good this feels normal there's just a lot of things to focus on all at once and so that is that is i think that's just the normal path so appreciate this though thank you for all the ideas and the pushes really appreciate it awesome yeah chad is more stuff comes up even and we'll shift it to monthly but shot his stuff comes up on the phone",

      "audioTranscript": "until the elections that's pretty much what everyone is that's the sense i'm getting from everybody this sounds great and let's let's see what happens in november and so i know that lydia and rosemary and anna and i are supposed to be getting something on the calendar for november to like as like okay where are we now now that we know more like what's what's our next step i think that feels separate from what i'm doing or trying to do with tony right so would still like to talk about that but those are those are the kinds of conversations we could hold in a monthly check in so i'm all for it probably helps with your calendars as well but it definitely helps with mine great and just to say allowed mister duncan i talked about if we shift a month to which sounds like we're all on the same page too feel free to reach out at any time if it's helpful to chat in the meantime or if it's helpful for us to look at stuff asynchronously the goal of this is to better match your the time you're spending in meetings to what you're trying to accomplish but like if that comes up and you need eyes that you're not getting or thoughts partnership like just show yeah that's that's great that's great yeah okay well that's that should be fairly easy to kind of shift it's really just like one meeting drops off and we just keep the other one right so yeah okay great that sounds good just on my end too if there's like obviously people call me anytime or if there's like an ad hoc conversation you can always email julie who manages my schedule and just be like does what do you have any guide time in the next to look over here either way that's great yeah i'll take advantage of that more i haven't taken advantage of that at all but julie because it's just it's up until now it's been working to just text and you know either you or i decide yeah this is a phone call let's just hop on the phone yeah yeah yeah that's great i appreciate the just consideration of calendar i mean i know you got you all think about that a lot too and just how do we align that to priorities this is great let's see really quick can i give you if it's okay to move on y just an update on finance sudanshi i just want to give a quick update there made a connection with alpine we're in the process of opening that account i expect it to be open by middle to late next week is what we're shooting for i spoke to ian ian's great they seem awesome they just really they just really get it and because my needs right now are just so basic you know it's it's it'll go really fast right really just setting up two accounts one for csf and the other is just the operating keep everything separate and make it really clean and transparent so that's that's what i'm doing in the process of doing that now they just needed my articles and ein and things like that so i'll be getting that to them today and then waiting for next steps i think there's a form i need to sign things like that okay so that's that's my update there kind of the way i'm thinking about it is like and you pushed on this thinking is i think there's really like three big phases to this right phase one is what i'm in which is there is grant money in this account no co mingling in that account there's an operating piece and then i'm working with shannon shannon's great by the way love her i think clicked very quickly based on her experience she's helping me just set up some of the infrastructure for just payroll so that just to make it clean and kind of automatic for reporting as well again just transparent is what i want and that that'll kick off here pretty soon i guess end of october and then really the only other reason for using operating the operating account would be for the things i'm using it for now which is just i travel or you know paying for consultant support things like that yeah perfect i think yeah shannon is great and then i think you had mentioned about like just keeping accounts clean from get go i think will help next year as you file the five hundred one and all the documentation that would be required so that's good yeah yeah yeah yeah she she i mean there's a lot of things i appreciate about her but one of the big things is oh we should be using these codes now that'll get you really used to like state codes later and just like how do we how do we make things really clear now so that the next phase the next couple of phases are just become building blocks and not we're not having to clean anything up in the future so she is a she is smart she is very experienced and very very skilled so i appreciate the connection awesome let's see here oh along along with that can i can i get a little bit at the information about the we went back and forth a little bit about csgf and some you mentioned there's there's the grant opportunity that you were kind of i got the sense that you were encouraged me to like look into it and so i i just would love to learn more yeah and lydia feel free to share but justin so csgf like every year they have this funding opportunity like if that's more of a cohort model that they have which every october to december they open the application and then go through the process and by june they finalize their investments so they have two tracks there one is the school like schools that are opening next fall and or schools that are replicating or expanding like that is one track and then the other track is just eir program where schools are like at least one and a half two years away from the launch so eir program is basically like they'll give two hundred fifty k funding but then then like the re up of that and like if the school successfully opens and like you meet the milestones like you will call it automatically qualify for fundraising like startup funding for first three to four years so so that is the eir track given like the charter is not approved and you're still working on the application my sense was that eir track would make more sense to apply for now my guess is that it the funding will be contingent upon you getting the charter but by june like their approval and like your charter timeline will will work together so that is something and because they deadline is december i was like if if you have if you can apply now and get into the process that'll be that'll make it easier okay lydia anything else on the csgf front um i don't think so the one thing she can have to i'm just thinking we might want to check in with our team on is whether i think it still makes sense to apply this fall sometimes they're like more likely to approve you the closer you are to opening but i think they're also trying to support more innovative models with experienced leaders and so i think you'll have a really good shot just in but if we could just double check that it says fall that makes the most sense yeah so just i'll just take that they would be silly not to give you the funding in my opinion yeah so justin i'll take the next step on me like i'll just connect with the the c team member who is leading the sourcing and then i'll double check and then put you in touch if you have any questions that sounds great it sounds like if it's a match and it's not too early and this is something they would they would likely support what i'm hearing from you all is encouragement to apply like this is this is a really strong pathway especially because it leads to like no more funding later yeah okay yeah yeah okay so you don't find out until june it's a very long process i think you find out like that you'd be moved on earlier but i think our final sport approval is in june like the final final got it okay great well then i'll hang tight then for now yeah okay let's see here i'd love to just get give y'all an update on the these site visits and kind of like what i'm taking away it's quite a bit you know it's you you all have been many many school visits so this will probably sound familiar it's like you go to some schools and there there are like tidbits that you'll pull out that you're like oh my gosh that is excellent how did that happen and let me try to unpack that and then i'll go to some where it's like i i have to really think so much of the school is excellent like how did this entire thing happen you know it's like it's like a different situation and then like the third bucket is this is being presented as an exemplar and i don't think it is what right like that that is a that is a totally different and so i for those visits i'm kind of just like gracious and supportive and like it's more about the relationship and that sort of thing and luckily there haven't been many in the third bucket you know i think if if i were to boil it down the george washington carver collegiate academies in new orleans i've never been to a school like that before in my life and i've i've run lots of schools i've seen lots of schools and i it was a school visit that really adjusted my bar for excellence in high school and that's that's saying a lot i don't say that lightly because i think i've i've seen and i've run really really good schools that i i would have called excellent and now i think i'm calling them good compared to what i've seen there specifically with culture and just like adult culture and how that translates into well daily action intervention goal setting and student support i would call it overall like the the the two words i'm taking away from that is just this is what radical ownership looks like in a school right and so that that has pushed me to refine even how i think about culture and aliento and really like how does you know that i i want i went there originally because like like so many other people who have gone there it's like how are you catching kids up this fast who are coming that fr behind in the ninth grade that's that's really the reason why i went there and i i learned exactly how and it wasn't exactly what i thought like they certainly have the programs but they also have the the culture that drives the programs which again just seems like very of course it does but it was so visceral that that that has pushed me to kind of refine even how i think about like the pillars and some of and like the narrowing of focus in the programming especially in year one and two of the schools that that that was just that was a good level i could go into more detail there but that was pretty incredible i think comp side was pretty phenomenal i think the i'm sorry lydia go ahead i was just going to say justin you know collegiate academy's founder his name is ben markovitz have you had a chance to do you know him or have you ever chanced to interact with him no no i just i just worked with the cao there the reason i bring it up is that ben is now doing coaching work and all aligned around how do you build mindsets and adults that result in the kind of culture that you saw there and his whole philosophy is that that's where that's the beginning the middle and the end of it is around to be an adult culture where everyone feels like it's their responsibility to grow kids and is feeling accountable to that but in like a positive joyful way and anyway he's fabulous and he's now doing he he's now that's like all he's doing now is like working with other leaders around how to do that and so i can connect you if you're interested in talking to him more and maybe even building a deeper relationship as you're thinking about it instill that that would be great that would be great i spent the day with the cao she's granted we kind of go we realize we had a connection from a long time ago so that was justin that's like how you said that line say that like almost every day it's it's a little ridiculous and humorous at this point where it's like yeah we know each other from this and i'm like oh my in a really good way it's pretty yeah she just i mean they open their entire they just pull the curtain back i spent a lot of time in intervention there spends a lot of time talking to their dean of culture there spend some time talking to kids there i would love to talk to ben that'd be great i don't know him yet but okay cool outside so upside so the instruction at comp sci i thought could be better i didn't think the instrument but you know like every school has a day where they just have five people out and that sort of thing and i think when i heard from several people i wanted you to see this person but they're not here so i think they just had like a lot of subs in things like that and yet the culture was great even with subs i spend a lot of time with kids at that school and i spends a lot of time with their post secondary team at that school i think that's kind of the gem of that school the post secondary team and how they weave collagen career together because it's a bit of a dance and there's a lot of nuance they do it very very well they're more of like a breadth model rather than a depth model but still there is a lot that i just started to think about in terms of like relevant pathways and how does that how does that kind of like push me to refine pathway offerings a little bit differently and they push me on like just didn't push me i push myself based on that conversation just staffing model a bit like just thinking about staffing model what does it take in like a year one to pull something like that off because it wouldn't be i mean they're fully grown so it'd be slightly different obviously and yeah so i took a lot of way about just what is what is like who does what went like how does this actually work in a year one year two scenario with with the team and how do you this has actually come up quite a bit like how do you make this super uber passionate team that is focused on college and career really gets in it how do you how do you like contextualize that mindset and thinking into core academics where most of those folks are like they were never in industry their career educators their k twelve folks they're you know they have like a completely different mindset and a lot of them like how do you connect the two mindsets together and have one culture driving toward the same thing that is that is harder than it sounds like it should be especially in those schools that are just known for these kinds of pathways i spoke to a couple of bio teachers who i thought in my head i was like surely like you could see how your work connects to the pathways especially the science pathways the kids are pursuing and she struggled to explain that you know it was like wow even at a comp side which is like this is what they do that's hard right and so kind of like with collegiate like i keep going back to how important hiring is going to be in in addition to like the infrastructure for the staffing model it's like hiring the right people is just going to be so important and then the third that i wanted to like lift up i should probably just drop this here this might actually be helpful because i'm not going to go through all of it but you might see something that you want to learn more about and it's helpful for me to talk about it because it just helps me process on kind of the external process or in that way this is kind of where i'm keeping broad notes you don't want to see my journal it won't make sense to anyone at barely making sense to me so this is kind of where i'm just trying to capture broad strokes the third one was an recommendation and that was aviation high school in in long island y'all that school is incredible i it's you know ninety year old public school started in like i think something like nineteen twenty five it's crazy oh yeah sure let's see here and let's see and what it had told me like she'd been wanting to see the school for a while but it had been really hard to kind of break in and get a connection all of that i thought it was pretty easy like i just emailed the principal and he was like sure and he like personally walked me around for ninety minutes in that school i saw everything from ninth all the way up this place is like it's six i mean i can't i don't i won't have a school like this like there's there's no way but someday what they can would be incredible i mean it's like a six story two city block school two thousand kids they have a hangar on site they have like full airplanes in this hangar with like kids like inside of the engines like pressure testing wires and things that i don't even understand and then like talking to each other but the way they build it from ninth all the way up you know if if all you saw was the flashy twelfth graders tell me about their you know interviews with america airlines and working on the inside of these engines and that's all you saw it would be impossible for you to say like well how did that happen right you have to go to ninth grade and you have to see what they're working on in ninth grade and you could just see how clearly like they're just building it every year like this was like the best example of depth in pathway programming i've seen what were there student demographics like well they they pull kids from off the pi burrows it's like a it's like a what they call a cte club they have five these hubs there's six of these hubs this one focused on aviation and aerospace you you apply to get in but it's not based on grades or status or anything it's like they can just only offer a certain amount of seats so i think there's like a say involved i'm not sure exactly how that works but they're demographics were i mean they still had twenty five percent emergent bilinguals they still have like i think seven or seventeen there's sixteen or seventeen percent special education most of their kids i think they had it was there only twenty twenty only twenty four percent of their kids in the specific pathways program were female students like a low number but compared to like the other programs he was careful to note that that's actually a pretty high number because like we're just any any female student who says they're interested we pretty much just let them in because we're just trying to make those numbers go as high as possible so there were a lot of like reasons why this like i wouldn't want a school exactly like this right but like the program itself and how they've set that up and how they contextualize it in academics i want to learn more about that but there there is there is a connection there obviously they've had a long long time to make this happen but they still have budget constraints they still had all the same problems that a normal public school has they weren't immune to any of those things but i i guess my my biggest takeaway in programming was just like rap and i think it's well deserved in some cases but the the bad rap of like well cte program is x and that's kind of like this other options and alternative options the only option that you justin can have because of your grades and because of a whole lot of other things this this was like the strongest example of what rigor should look like in high school like just the depth the precision the discipline because every kid in that program is working toward faa certification which i i knew this much before i went there about what that meant and i know a lot more like it is very very very rigorous what it takes so that level of precision and discipline i think also appeals like when you talk about it like that i think that appeals to industry folks like that's the kind of like precision and discipline and like high expectations that are expected to see if they're if they're going to hire someone or hire somebody and put them through college while you're working for them like that's what they expect and i think without knowing that i think k twelve misses that level of rigor like that's what you're working towards this is what you want kids to be able to access you're not going to access that if you have like an aimless curriculum and if you're not building up on that rigor really from day one so i'm kind of going all over the place but it's like push me on mission vision commitment it's pushed me on like the exact pillars like how am i precisely talking about the pillars that i want to offer them and then how does that push me on narrowing offerings that's this is kind of what's been going through my head for the last three weeks awesome here curious is it helping you narrow what your learning agenda is for future visits like what does it implementation for you're trying to figure out for business that are coming up yeah because my other my next two visits coming up are to davinci and domain and i i really have like two kind of essential two essential questions that i that i now want to learn from those two places because i think i do think those two places do this pretty well like i need to learn more about the actual partnerships in not just curriculum but instruction for a lot of these pathways like it was clear to me how aviation high school did it because i do most of it in house but they've had like ninety years to work on that right so it looked like a stumbling block for comp side like i think that was a stumbling block the curriculum connection but also the they had to go outside the school for almost everything which put a lot of weight on the post secondary team like they have to have a robust post secondary team in order to like basically hustle in fact the leader of that team called herself like the chief hustler because they like she she has to like constantly find and and also the liaison that's funny i just made this the liaison for and shoots at act and then dsst aurora school also calls herself like a hustler like these are people who are like if that falls through we got to work with this person so i'm kind of more interested in like well how do you just create a more consistent relationship that's based on like the rigor of the teaching and curriculum in the pathway during the school day whether it's an internship or on campus like how do you do that and i think i think davinci does that better and then the second piece that i'm still struggling to understand how people do this differently is that connection between pathway and core academics and how do they make this like a scene with this connection because that's really the skills mapping idea that i was thinking about like how do you map the durable skills competencies between core academics and industry but also the mindsets of the adults i think those are those are some things those are two things that i'm wanting to learn more about i mean honestly it connects to like in a in a really strange way it connects to george washington our pretty collegiate academics like pretty well i mean it's it's not that different right i mean they're just their context is like intervention acceleration closing gaps and like everyone's a part of that there is radical ownership of everybody every single day on the prize and what i'm saying is that yes and that adult culture and focus has to be applied to more academics and pathway work as well like we are all owning that there is depth and programming so the kids have as many options as they as they can possibly have dustin the i don't know if you're going to have a chance to make it over to elevate hopefully this year sometime in idaho but yeah i think it's on the calendar oh great okay i was just gonna say that's an example of a school where i feel like they integrate the like hooks in the pathway career pathways work really well into the core academics of the school and so that's just one thing that's maybe spend a little bit extra time with them on when you're there how they do the planning with the pathways teachers and the core content teachers together yeah that seems that's great that's that's that's the second thing that i'm trying to learn more about and i'm going to elevate i think beginning of november is what we landed on so and this occurs to me on your second question if when the unity innovation center lands kirsten you like the idea of alex kids accessing dps services adds an additional wrinkle to this right it's like all right what kind of complexity are you introducing in that applications of that for maintaining and sustaining a unified adult culture yes wherever the students are yeah yes that's exactly right yeah i was thinking about that a lot i was like you know in a true collaboration we should be collaborating on culture you know but like by definition unless something's done intentionally by definition those two schools in a similar in the same building are going to have different cultures you know and maybe that's okay right but i think it needs to be named that the closer we didn't align the better i mean i could hear tony tonight tony's just going to be like just take the middle school too because i you know but i i do think that could be that that that is an interesting point and that's something i'm going to have to like think about like if you're ready to switch i mean that's the only other thing that was on my my list was was that was that where the dps work yes they do to the innovations center i i was like i got to call this something that you know but i really did it really did feel like you you don't i mean there are too many data points now that are just like there is no plan and people are like like kind of like low key frustrated about that like the various people are just like this doesn't disservice to the the folks who voted there's a big deal you know and so again my push continues to be like well unless you tell me no like i'm going to keep going right and just you know i think again tony and others and everybody you know just holding their breath for for november and so when they get that meeting on the calendar with you know rosemary and others in november but that the i haven't figured out exactly how i want to leverage the what's it called the kind of like value proposition that and and i don't know i may add more to it but let me just drop that in the chat and in case it's easier to access it there greg thank you for all the comments in it i need to i mostly responded to the comments i'm still digesting them and i haven't really done a lot of work to go back into it this is my like i started to think like if i were tony and i was talking about this or arguing for this what would i need to be armed with in order to have a substantive conversation about this with someone else and so that's where this two pager kind of idea came from it's like this is what i would want if if i wasn't there this is what i would hope that others would say we were talking to like a board member talking to other people and so that's where this came from if there's something else i think like a way especially an opportunity if you see one you know in that you internet proposal like the the seven page proposal if i'm not addressing something else that's a bit of an elephant in the room in that proposal i i want to be able to address that in this value proposition document because the document itself is less important i think this language could be used in a slide deck or talking voice or something like that could be use a variety of ways so the only other thing i'll say is i haven't gotten anything else on tony's calendar but i think i'm going to reach out to his ea and just because that was our last text hey we should get something on the calendar so i'm going to reach out and see if i can't get something on the calendar and then for aps doing the same i've reached out to i think her name is candice to get on giles's calendar i have a feeling that both people are going to push me to like let's meet november which is fine like just tell me tell me no then tell me to pause tell me to stop and it might charter application thinking and planning i'm just i'm still i'm just still planning for both dps and aps at this point i thought this was really helpful and like i like how concise it is my concrete and two of arching costs one of which i alluded to in my email back to you justin but with one was and it's a i was like maybe we just don't know exactly yet but exactly what you were just saying i think it it seemed like sort of tweaks to what you've captured here and how it translates to a deck really depends on like all right who is the ultimate audience going to be and what do they need to hear like what are they and so i just wonder next time next time you do get a chance with tony if it makes sense to just ask that if the rest of the conversation is flowing along the path of course next steps of just asking the question directly but like if i'm going to hit four what if what is for audience x what is my what do they need to hear and i didn't have enough of a lens on who the audience would be or if we're thinking about general dps if there's stuff missing here but it might be just worth asking folks directly as you interact with them then the second thought which feels very down the road but it's just occurring to me as i'm reading this is i find this idea very exciting also has complexity super important to be successful in year one and so just like thinking through as as this idea is evolving all right what does this mean i need to be really good at in year one and am i still sort of defining a manageable set of things that i'm going to be able to nail into year one and then are there like that caveat maybe not the right word but like if this stuff that you're worried about like might take building boards are there with ways to sort of signal that early so that expertise are aligned so i was trying to read it with that lens and so just naming it as a i'm sure you're thinking about that but just like i think it's easy as we get down the sort of idea and sort of communicate with dps pathway to get a bunch on there and i think supporting occasionally revisit it they're like all right is there anything on here i feel like it's gonna be really hard to execute in your own thoughts yeah i love it like one thing that comes to mind you know that the complexity of the like the shared cross enrollment idea i don't i don't know and this is maybe something i would need to write somewhere i don't know that that's something that we would even leverage until probably year two right because the reason why a student from dps another school would want to leverage a pathway with us would be that's a specific pathway that goes into the right level of depth and i want to access that well we're we're not going to offer something like that until a year or two right until there's sophomores i mean in year one it's going to be three things it's going to be it's going to be culture it's going to be rigor and academics that the intervention specifically and it's going to be identity work that's it that's really it i mean without the identity work students are co designing and thinking about how their passions and their purpose align right so that's that is critical the culture when i mean by that is similar to what we've been talking about this call like the old culture and the culture of these pathways and how they're integrated i think that is going to be probably priority number one and then of course the academics the intervention quite frankly like catching kids up otherwise none of this matters if they're not caught up quickly none of this matters if it's not connected to who they are it doesn't matter it's just a normal school like any other and if the culture isn't there then this isn't different either so those are like the three things that we have to nail and they're kind of all venn diagram they kind of all you know connect together so it just it none of that is really sexy to be honest it might be i think it is i think it is right but if you look on the surface it's like well how is that innovative it's like it's incredibly innovative not a lot of schools do that well yeah so that makes a ton of sense and this is i think a little carp before the horse but i think the question is just as you get as you start having conversations with more of tony and green lights you'd be talking to a lot of folks are there any of those expectation management things that you just named that are important to try to be explicit about so you don't get to a place where someone's like wait a minute like i thought you were bringing in a bunch of dbs students who aren't in atlanta and you're want and then people i think down the road but just wanted to name it as think about as yeah your push is great generally on managing people's expectations are helpful so yeah thank you i was just gonna add two more quick thoughts on this and justin i think the document's awesome you know the what strikes me whether this is gonna work or not mvps is obviously politics which we have no control over but then the excitement around the vision and the meeting the unmet need and the second is you justin and so i actually i know this is not your nature but i think we need to like even on this talk about the work that you've been doing in ddps and with dps in the relational trust in the fact that you believe in dps winning and that's part of the difference in the third way approach that you're coming at this with and then i would go a little punch even a little stronger on the first chunk on vision from like an aspirational here's what's possible for our young people to like truly deliver like you now have that vision of that aviation school and it's like we don't have anything like this in denver okay bring that energy into the okay and related to that point justin i was thinking and the context that you shared about like hey ear what like this is the focus and like we are not talking about like hey industry and internships and like all those pieces like that is you'll start those conversations but like but just in this piece and to the point that lydia made about like aviation and like highlighting that i was just wondering like if there are like one or two partners who can stamp this or like industry partners who can stamp this which increases the weight in conversations with dps is that boeing said this or like going is aligned on this so like just those pieces of like if if not a formal partnership at least the their codes around the need part yeah yeah yeah even like as a quote in that two pager no as in like just generally i think you had highlighted right like the why aerospace and why now but yeah where you have quoted like what their projections are but like just making it more personal in terms of like hey they're head of dia or denver airport said diet or like again you are having those conversations i was just wondering like if they have shared like same need or same yeah they usually go a step further you know yeah bill usually goes separately like for an example i'll say you know like like deborah wilcox or something but because she's the chair for the colorado aerospace business roundtable her name comes up a lot and as she's very enthusiastic about this work she was just kind of one upping me the entire conversation like i would say well this statistic seems like this would be necessary she's like oh no it's greater than that there's a huge need and she would talk about like average age of you know an aerospace engineer is x and so yeah i think you're right and yeah it was just your feedback is like how do you punch this up right bunch this up and then just showing this plan as an endorsement from the industry yeah kind of creates more impact on your industry partnership vision yeah there's about to be a lot more of that happening this month with chris chavez so this is yeah i need to be gathering that in these conversations that would be easy to do love it okay great gosh i don't know how i think we're almost in time again let's see here the rest of the things i have on my list are more just like updates i think the main things we were able to get to yeah no one thing on the charter application stuff which yes you you all already gone back and forth on and i'm sure you've already on your radar justin but just naming that for each of the processes there's like a first step of either reaching out to somebody or attending trainings and all the websites have like the moment that the the updated timeline is going to be up there and all that kind of stuff probably already on your radar but just worth checking at some point again to make sure you know what the first step is in each place and when you want to do it like on dps's website for example it says you should reach out to the authorizing team if you're interested and it gives their email so now to jump in here if you have a point of view i'm not sure about the right timing is to do that like i think i might wait until after you've gotten some traction with tony to do that or whoever else but like just naming that there is that step so make sure you know what that step is in each place and can think about that all right when do i need to pull the trigger on that that's a really good point for aps it's really really fuzzy yeah i think for dps still fuzzy but again the criteria for the application is senior leadership co signing on this idea and there's a facility involved like ddps from a little bit more aligned with that with dps than with aps my sense with aps is that they are overwhelmed and they're already thinking about this comprehensive high school and dss t commingling is a facility even on the table i have no idea i have no idea part of me wonders if it is so what you're saying is just like take those start dates and take this like first steps into account with the plan yeah and just to name a lot my word is just there's always a risk in any of these things that you miss sort of a bureaucratic milestone right and then get into a reactive mode so just like and that is a make sure you're starting the processes at the appropriate time is a good way to make sure you're not missing us so that's all it's not a huge deal i just want to make sure there are no and just to note i was thinking like when you speak to alyssa like talk about them project managing some of these steps so that they are keeping a tab of all these key milestones or timelines that you need to meet in terms of submitting the charter okay great okay what am i forgetting i had one completely different question for you justin answer today but just to kind of put on your radar that i've been thinking about i'm wondering if the second half of this year is a good time to test anything that you've been wondering about or if you're thinking about doing that next fall but situanch and i were at a school that just opened this fall there's a very different model this week and they had the opportunity to really test for like a long period of time last year and learn so much that informed the ultimate model and it just it just made me think about that question for you and i feel like we have a lot of good partners who might be open to allowing you to do something you know what pieces of the model the ones you feel most that need to do that but just encourage you to think about that next twelve month period yeah i had originally planned to just even test some of the model ideas with like a group of kids just you know even yeah that's what i mean okay let me think about that some more okay and that might be like a summer like maybe that's like a next summer thing like it's summer program you can offer or you know anyway i think it'll come to you once you figure out what pieces of it are the ones that that you yeah i can tell you the first thing that comes to mind is even just testing what that agenda should be for the like summer bridge going into ninth grade i mean that that's something that people do very differently from place to place and that is that is something that i would probably test and i think we tested in the summer yeah that's good thank you i'm adding publicity here which may be the wrong idea but love that testing idea and presumably it's government getting traction on the unity idea summer you could test the summer bridge with dps in some ways and that might be a way to get really concrete collaboration on something the student centered early so that might make it harder to execute but might have some real dividends and building relationships and getting traction yeah justin sorry i love that craig last thought on this because i think i was supposed to introduce you to ann peakey at aps two which i can do if you want to meet with her it'll probably she'll probably want to wait till after the board election because she's running for reelection and it's crazy so i might honestly it may make sense to just wait a few weeks i think to make that introduction i think it's going to be highly unlikely aps is going to give you district space for this i just don't think it fits cleanly enough into their current plans and they're like a little wedded to their current plans right now the only other wondering i have is whether it's following back up with twenty seven j which who told me explicitly that they're going to have extra space in one of their high schools that's ten minutes from the airport just as like another i don't i'm like wary of like giving you too many political paths to try to start working on but at the same time i feel like it's like applying to college like we need a safety school you know i agree so anyway maybe think about that a little bit but that just might be one other something else worth thinking about do you think that's something that we should i keep thinking about this like kind of circling the wagons meeting in november that we were on that text thread about with rosemary is that something we bring into a conversation like that just like what are the what's the a path the beep have or is that a different conversation because i agree with you it's everything feels tenuous right and obviously it'll be more clear in november but it's not it's not a great strategy you just have to like this this unity proposal that i threw together for them like that's the path that feels very tenuous yeah i mean it feels pretty clear in my mind i don't know greg i respond to if you have thoughts that that the dps path is like by far the best one if we could figure it out for a myriad of reasons from the fact that that really is the airport district and like as you deep in partnerships there like that just as logical it makes sense they have this plan they don't have a plan they have the money the building they have the plan like there's just you have the relationship like i think ninety five percent of your energy honestly should be going on the dps route and that will include like the second we know who gets elected to the far northeast school board district you we want to make sure you're meeting with them you know all the all those things and so i think it might be maybe maybe as i'm talking it through maybe we just wait until i don't think we need to hash that out in the conversation with rosary but you and i could just get on the phone the day after the elections justin and be like okay well what does this do for game plan and then and then we could we can fire on the safety school twenty seven j introduction sounds good do you have it does that sound does that sound right to you yeah i think that all sounds right and justin the thing i'd be curious about honestly is given your relationship with tony like at what point is there a point in which you feel like you're getting a clear read from him on his like his confidence on the path because i like i think in my head that's a big part of like your relationship is a big part of why the dps path feels promising yeah it's really the only reason why this feels promising yeah so like i think it's worth just saying out loud like yeah like is there a point at which you you will know that you're getting a sort of ambiguous signal from tony and so because like he's and it's probably post election but just naming our label like testing with tony feels like a big gateway for increasing decreasing confidence and then yeah lydia the only thing i'd add to your point is it might be worth just looking quickly at twenty seven j timelines which i don't think is probably at all urgent but like the election hubbling after the election makes sense and then knowing all right if we do go the safety route what vvc be true by when in order to feel like we're kind of out passing yeah yeah i i mean from what i know about tony which it's turning out to be like actually i know a lot about somebody because it's been pretty accurate so far he's a pretty straight shooter type of person like he he doesn't like to kind of beat around the bush and so the positive signals that i'm getting from him like i trust those signals he would not be saying i mean he would just tell me like there's not a shot in hell just like just hold on he would tell me that you know i think you also there's like an inference that i'm making too that he and i both understand that he doesn't make those decision the board makes this decision so so much of it just really depends on what happens in the next couple of weeks yeah i mean it's it's making me think you know i i'm gonna reach out again to his ea i'll just text him and say hey like just follow me because in the last text thread we had it was like i think we need another meeting tony to just like talk about this and he was like yeah thumbs up so i think i'm just gonna follow up with like does it make sense for us to get together in the next couple of weeks or do you want to wait until november to to get together and talk about this some more in the meantime i have a two pager i'm working on to help any of us with language on how to like like position this isn't in a value proposition way i'm happy to send that to you just tell me what tell me what you think i'm does that i think this fish is the way you just described but you know tony adele but like i do think it would be a mistake to do any like push any false urgency if he's like wait so i'm not starting it needs to like rush it past like with whatever his pace it feels appropriate but just naming like you'll get a clear signal at some points here and then that will be really helpful and indicating great okay and lydia you mentioned when you talk to twenty seven j before if i remember correctly it was kind of like they were sort of like we've got this space but i think your read was like they both they don't know what they want or they're sophisticated kindly so yeah yeah we'd have to like really like walk through you know yes here's what this could look like etcetera justin the last thing how are you feeling about like actual family and student interest in the model yeah i've i i'm scheduled to have a meeting with families in early november i have a connection with the elk community center they do a lot of work with denver families just in engagement with families in the far north east i'm actually meeting with them next week it looks like next week i had my first meeting with them they've been very open to just like having family meetings there my my sense from folks i've been talking to matthew and then griselda this place is like it seems like a no brainer that families want this opportunity and it seems like it feels ironic to them that they see in the news that people complain about talent and they're like well we don't have access to that i i want i want feedback on the actual model itself right my worry and the one thing that i think is going to come up is this isn't a comprehensive high school model you know and so there is like you know families do want like some basic things out of high school they want safety they want strong academics and things like that but i'm also hearing that they you know what sports do we offer and things like that that can comprehensive high school would would offer and so i think there's going to be a i think there's going to be a sticking point there but i want to get more like of those trans meetings off the ground yeah and and i think justin has right to think about input into the model but i also think it's important to put on your like recruitment hat yeah like for this charter application to be approved and also for you to like have confidence that you're launching this school like you need to know that there are kids who are going to be signed up to you know who right now are seventh graders who are going to be your students right and start building that base of like literally thinking of it like a letters of intent how how are we tracking towards progress you probably already think about this but still offset like but but as you're starting this conversation i think it's worth trying to come out with all those conversations with list of names of the folks who were there and contact information but similar to sinatra's industry point like capture the quotes that you hear along the way because i'm sure those are going to be usable and then delete the letters of intent as appropriate but it's worth using every single family interaction i think with that recruitment hat on to build list of potential interested families good to see you as well sorry justin i feel like we were like just throwing a lot at you but super excited about where you are and all the all the inspiration you're taking from the schools that you've been visiting too it's awesome this is good this feels normal there's just a lot of things to focus on all at once and so that is that is i think that's just the normal path so appreciate this though thank you for all the ideas and the pushes really appreciate it awesome yeah chad is more stuff comes up even and we'll shift it to monthly but shot his stuff comes up on the phone",

know that lydia and rosemary and anna and i are supposed to be getting something on the calendar for november to like as like okay where are we now now that we know more like what's what's our next step i think that feels separate from what i'm doing or trying to do with tony right so would still like to talk about that but those are those are the kinds of conversations we could hold in a monthly check in so i'm all for it probably helps with your calendars as well but it definitely helps with mine great and just to say allowed mister duncan i talked about if we shift a month to which sounds like we're all on the same page too feel free to reach out at any time if it's helpful to chat in the meantime or if it's helpful for us to look at stuff asynchronously the goal of this is to better match your the time you're spending in meetings to what you're trying to accomplish but like if that comes up and you need eyes that you're not getting or thoughts partnership like just show yeah that's that's great that's great yeah okay well that's that should be fairly easy to kind of shift it's really just like one meeting drops off and we just keep the other one right so yeah okay great that sounds good just on my end too if there's like obviously people call me anytime or if there's like an ad hoc conversation you can always email julie who manages my schedule and just be like does what do you have any guide time in the next to look over here either way that's great yeah i'll take advantage of that more i haven't taken advantage of that at all but julie because it's just it's up until now it's been working to just text and you know either you or i decide yeah this is a phone call let's just hop on the phone yeah yeah yeah that's great i appreciate the just consideration of calendar i mean i know you got you all think about that a lot too and just how do we align that to priorities this is great let's see really quick can i give you if it's okay to move on y just an update on finance sudanshi i just want to give a quick update there made a connection with alpine we're in the process of opening that account i expect it to be open by middle to late next week is what we're shooting for i spoke to ian ian's great they seem awesome they just really they just really get it and because my needs right now are just so basic you know it's it's it'll go really fast right really just setting up two accounts one for csf and the other is just the operating keep everything separate and make it really clean and transparent so that's that's what i'm doing in the process of doing that now they just needed my articles and ein and things like that so i'll be getting that to them today and then waiting for next steps i think there's a form i need to sign things like that okay so that's that's my update there kind of the way i'm thinking about it is like and you pushed on this thinking is i think there's really like three big phases to this right phase one is what i'm in which is there is grant money in this account no co mingling in that account there's an operating piece and then i'm working with shannon shannon's great by the way love her i think clicked very quickly based on her experience she's helping me just set up some of the infrastructure for just payroll so that just to make it clean and kind of automatic for reporting as well again just transparent is what i want and that that'll kick off here pretty soon i guess end of october and then really the only other reason for using operating the operating account would be for the things i'm using it for now which is just i travel or you know paying for consultant support things like that yeah perfect i think yeah shannon is great and then i think you had mentioned about like just keeping accounts clean from get go i think will help next year as you file the five hundred one and all the documentation that would be required so that's good yeah yeah yeah yeah she she i mean there's a lot of things i appreciate about her but one of the big things is oh we should be using these codes now that'll get you really used to like state codes later and just like how do we how do we make things really clear now so that the next phase the next couple of phases are just become building blocks and not we're not having to clean anything up in the future so she is a she is smart she is very experienced and very very skilled so i appreciate the connection awesome let's see here oh along along with that can i can i get a little bit at the information about the we went back and forth a little bit about csgf and some you mentioned there's there's the grant opportunity that you were kind of i got the sense that you were encouraged me to like look into it and so i i just would love to learn more yeah and lydia feel free to share but justin so csgf like every year they have this funding opportunity like if that's more of a cohort model that they have which every october to december they open the application and then go through the process and by june they finalize their investments so they have two tracks there one is the school like schools that are opening next fall and or schools that are replicating or expanding like that is one track and then the other track is just eir program where schools are like at least one and a half two years away from the launch so eir program is basically like they'll give two hundred fifty k funding but then then like the re up of that and like if the school successfully opens and like you meet the milestones like you will call it automatically qualify for fundraising like startup funding for first three to four years so so that is the eir track given like the charter is not approved and you're still working on the application my sense was that eir track would make more sense to apply for now my guess is that it the funding will be contingent upon you getting the charter but by june like their approval and like your charter timeline will will work together so that is something and because they deadline is december i was like if if you have if you can apply now and get into the process that'll be that'll make it easier okay lydia anything else on the csgf front um i don't think so the one thing she can have to i'm just thinking we might want to check in with our team on is whether i think it still makes sense to apply this fall sometimes they're like more likely to approve you the closer you are to opening but i think they're also trying to support more innovative models with experienced leaders and so i think you'll have a really good shot just in but if we could just double check that it says fall that makes the most sense yeah so just i'll just take that they would be silly not to give you the funding in my opinion yeah so justin i'll take the next step on me like i'll just connect with the the c team member who is leading the sourcing and then i'll double check and then put you in touch if you have any questions that sounds great it sounds like if it's a match and it's not too early and this is something they would they would likely support what i'm hearing from you all is encouragement to apply like this is this is a really strong pathway especially because it leads to like no more funding later yeah okay yeah yeah okay so you don't find out until june it's a very long process i think you find out like that you'd be moved on earlier but i think our final sport approval is in june like the final final got it okay great well then i'll hang tight then for now yeah okay let's see here i'd love to just get give y'all an update on the these site visits and kind of like what i'm taking away it's quite a bit you know it's you you all have been many many school visits so this will probably sound familiar it's like you go to some schools and there there are like tidbits that you'll pull out that you're like oh my gosh that is excellent how did that happen and let me try to unpack that and then i'll go to some where it's like i i have to really think so much of the school is excellent like how did this entire thing happen you know it's like it's like a different situation and then like the third bucket is this is being presented as an exemplar and i don't think it is what right like that that is a that is a totally different and so i for those visits i'm kind of just like gracious and supportive and like it's more about the relationship and that sort of thing and luckily there haven't been many in the third bucket you know i think if if i were to boil it down the george washington carver collegiate academies in new orleans i've never been to a school like that before in my life and i've i've run lots of schools i've seen lots of schools and i it was a school visit that really adjusted my bar for excellence in high school and that's that's saying a lot i don't say that lightly because i think i've i've seen and i've run really really good schools that i i would have called excellent and now i think i'm calling them good compared to what i've seen there specifically with culture and just like adult culture and how that translates into well daily action intervention goal setting and student support i would call it overall like the the the two words i'm taking away from that is just this is what radical ownership looks like in a school right and so that that has pushed me to refine even how i think about culture and aliento and really like how does you know that i i want i went there originally because like like so many other people who have gone there it's like how are you catching kids up this fast who are coming that fr behind in the ninth grade that's that's really the reason why i went there and i i learned exactly how and it wasn't exactly what i thought like they certainly have the programs but they also have the the culture that drives the programs which again just seems like very of course it does but it was so visceral that that that has pushed me to kind of refine even how i think about like the pillars and some of and like the narrowing of focus in the programming especially in year one and two of the schools that that that was just that was a good level i could go into more detail there but that was pretty incredible i think comp side was pretty phenomenal i think the i'm sorry lydia go ahead i was just going to say justin you know collegiate academy's founder his name is ben markovitz have you had a chance to do you know him or have you ever chanced to interact with him no no i just i just worked with the cao there the reason i bring it up is that ben is now doing coaching work and all aligned around how do you build mindsets and adults that result in the kind of culture that you saw there and his whole philosophy is that that's where that's the beginning the middle and the end of it is around to be an adult culture where everyone feels like it's their responsibility to grow kids and is feeling accountable to that but in like a positive joyful way and anyway he's fabulous and he's now doing he he's now that's like all he's doing now is like working with other leaders around how to do that and so i can connect you if you're interested in talking to him more and maybe even building a deeper relationship as you're thinking about it instill that that would be great that would be great i spent the day with the cao she's granted we kind of go we realize we had a connection from a long time ago so that was justin that's like how you said that line say that like almost every day it's it's a little ridiculous and humorous at this point where it's like yeah we know each other from this and i'm like oh my in a really good way it's pretty yeah she just i mean they open their entire they just pull the curtain back i spent a lot of time in intervention there spends a lot of time talking to their dean of culture there spend some time talking to kids there i would love to talk to ben that'd be great i don't know him yet but okay cool outside so upside so the instruction at comp sci i thought could be better i didn't think the instrument but you know like every school has a day where they just have five people out and that sort of thing and i think when i heard from several people i wanted you to see this person but they're not here so i think they just had like a lot of subs in things like that and yet the culture was great even with subs i spend a lot of time with kids at that school and i spends a lot of time with their post secondary team at that school i think that's kind of the gem of that school the post secondary team and how they weave collagen career together because it's a bit of a dance and there's a lot of nuance they do it very very well they're more of like a breadth model rather than a depth model but still there is a lot that i just started to think about in terms of like relevant pathways and how does that how does that kind of like push me to refine pathway offerings a little bit differently and they push me on like just didn't push me i push myself based on that conversation just staffing model a bit like just thinking about staffing model what does it take in like a year one to pull something like that off because it wouldn't be i mean they're fully grown so it'd be slightly different obviously and yeah so i took a lot of way about just what is what is like who does what went like how does this actually work in a year one year two scenario with with the team and how do you this has actually come up quite a bit like how do you make this super uber passionate team that is focused on college and career really gets in it how do you how do you like contextualize that mindset and thinking into core academics where most of those folks are like they were never in industry their career educators their k twelve folks they're you know they have like a completely different mindset and a lot of them like how do you connect the two mindsets together and have one culture driving toward the same thing that is that is harder than it sounds like it should be especially in those schools that are just known for these kinds of pathways i spoke to a couple of bio teachers who i thought in my head i was like surely like you could see how your work connects to the pathways especially the science pathways the kids are pursuing and she struggled to explain that you know it was like wow even at a comp side which is like this is what they do that's hard right and so kind of like with collegiate like i keep going back to how important hiring is going to be in in addition to like the infrastructure for the staffing model it's like hiring the right people is just going to be so important and then the third that i wanted to like lift up i should probably just drop this here this might actually be helpful because i'm not going to go through all of it but you might see something that you want to learn more about and it's helpful for me to talk about it because it just helps me process on kind of the external process or in that way this is kind of where i'm keeping broad notes you don't want to see my journal it won't make sense to anyone at barely making sense to me so this is kind of where i'm just trying to capture broad strokes the third one was an recommendation and that was aviation high school in in long island y'all that school is incredible i it's you know ninety year old public school started in like i think something like nineteen twenty five it's crazy oh yeah sure let's see here and let's see and what it had told me like she'd been wanting to see the school for a while but it had been really hard to kind of break in and get a connection all of that i thought it was pretty easy like i just emailed the principal and he was like sure and he like personally walked me around for ninety minutes in that school i saw everything from ninth all the way up this place is like it's six i mean i can't i don't i won't have a school like this like there's there's no way but someday what they can would be incredible i mean it's like a six story two city block school two thousand kids they have a hangar on site they have like full airplanes in this hangar with like kids like inside of the engines like pressure testing wires and things that i don't even understand and then like talking to each other but the way they build it from ninth all the way up you know if if all you saw was the flashy twelfth graders tell me about their you know interviews with america airlines and working on the inside of these engines and that's all you saw it would be impossible for you to say like well how did that happen right you have to go to ninth grade and you have to see what they're working on in ninth grade and you could just see how clearly like they're just building it every year like this was like the best example of depth in pathway programming i've seen what were there student demographics like well they they pull kids from off the pi burrows it's like a it's like a what they call a cte club they have five these hubs there's six of these hubs this one focused on aviation and aerospace you you apply to get in but it's not based on grades or status or anything it's like they can just only offer a certain amount of seats so i think there's like a say involved i'm not sure exactly how that works but they're demographics were i mean they still had twenty five percent emergent bilinguals they still have like i think seven or seventeen there's sixteen or seventeen percent special education most of their kids i think they had it was there only twenty twenty only twenty four percent of their kids in the specific pathways program were female students like a low number but compared to like the other programs he was careful to note that that's actually a pretty high number because like we're just any any female student who says they're interested we pretty much just let them in because we're just trying to make those numbers go as high as possible so there were a lot of like reasons why this like i wouldn't want a school exactly like this right but like the program itself and how they've set that up and how they contextualize it in academics i want to learn more about that but there there is there is a connection there obviously they've had a long long time to make this happen but they still have budget constraints they still had all the same problems that a normal public school has they weren't immune to any of those things but i i guess my my biggest takeaway in programming was just like rap and i think it's well deserved in some cases but the the bad rap of like well cte program is x and that's kind of like this other options and alternative options the only option that you justin can have because of your grades and because of a whole lot of other things this this was like the strongest example of what rigor should look like in high school like just the depth the precision the discipline because every kid in that program is working toward faa certification which i i knew this much before i went there about what that meant and i know a lot more like it is very very very rigorous what it takes so that level of precision and discipline i think also appeals like when you talk about it like that i think that appeals to industry folks like that's the kind of like precision and discipline and like high expectations that are expected to see if they're if they're going to hire someone or hire somebody and put them through college while you're working for them like that's what they expect and i think without knowing that i think k twelve misses that level of rigor like that's what you're working towards this is what you want kids to be able to access you're not going to access that if you have like an aimless curriculum and if you're not building up on that rigor really from day one so i'm kind of going all over the place but it's like push me on mission vision commitment it's pushed me on like the exact pillars like how am i precisely talking about the pillars that i want to offer them and then how does that push me on narrowing offerings that's this is kind of what's been going through my head for the last three weeks awesome here curious is it helping you narrow what your learning agenda is for future visits like what does it implementation for you're trying to figure out for business that are coming up yeah because my other my next two visits coming up are to davinci and domain and i i really have like two kind of essential two essential questions that i that i now want to learn from those two places because i think i do think those two places do this pretty well like i need to learn more about the actual partnerships in not just curriculum but instruction for a lot of these pathways like it was clear to me how aviation high school did it because i do most of it in house but they've had like ninety years to work on that right so it looked like a stumbling block for comp side like i think that was a stumbling block the curriculum connection but also the they had to go outside the school for almost everything which put a lot of weight on the post secondary team like they have to have a robust post secondary team in order to like basically hustle in fact the leader of that team called herself like the chief hustler because they like she she has to like constantly find and and also the liaison that's funny i just made this the liaison for and shoots at act and then dsst aurora school also calls herself like a hustler like these are people who are like if that falls through we got to work with this person so i'm kind of more interested in like well how do you just create a more consistent relationship that's based on like the rigor of the teaching and curriculum in the pathway during the school day whether it's an internship or on campus like how do you do that and i think i think davinci does that better and then the second piece that i'm still struggling to understand how people do this differently is that connection between pathway and core academics and how do they make this like a scene with this connection because that's really the skills mapping idea that i was thinking about like how do you map the durable skills competencies between core academics and industry but also the mindsets of the adults i think those are those are some things those are two things that i'm wanting to learn more about i mean honestly it connects to like in a in a really strange way it connects to george washington our pretty collegiate academics like pretty well i mean it's it's not that different right i mean they're just their context is like intervention acceleration closing gaps and like everyone's a part of that there is radical ownership of everybody every single day on the prize and what i'm saying is that yes and that adult culture and focus has to be applied to more academics and pathway work as well like we are all owning that there is depth and programming so the kids have as many options as they as they can possibly have dustin the i don't know if you're going to have a chance to make it over to elevate hopefully this year sometime in idaho but yeah i think it's on the calendar oh great okay i was just gonna say that's an example of a school where i feel like they integrate the like hooks in the pathway career pathways work really well into the core academics of the school and so that's just one thing that's maybe spend a little bit extra time with them on when you're there how they do the planning with the pathways teachers and the core content teachers together yeah that seems that's great that's that's that's the second thing that i'm trying to learn more about and i'm going to elevate i think beginning of november is what we landed on so and this occurs to me on your second question if when the unity innovation center lands kirsten you like the idea of alex kids accessing dps services adds an additional wrinkle to this right it's like all right what kind of complexity are you introducing in that applications of that for maintaining and sustaining a unified adult culture yes wherever the students are yeah yes that's exactly right yeah i was thinking about that a lot i was like you know in a true collaboration we should be collaborating on culture you know but like by definition unless something's done intentionally by definition those two schools in a similar in the same building are going to have different cultures you know and maybe that's okay right but i think it needs to be named that the closer we didn't align the better i mean i could hear tony tonight tony's just going to be like just take the middle school too because i you know but i i do think that could be that that that is an interesting point and that's something i'm going to have to like think about like if you're ready to switch i mean that's the only other thing that was on my my list was was that was that where the dps work yes they do to the innovations center i i was like i got to call this something that you know but i really did it really did feel like you you don't i mean there are too many data points now that are just like there is no plan and people are like like kind of like low key frustrated about that like the various people are just like this doesn't disservice to the the folks who voted there's a big deal you know and so again my push continues to be like well unless you tell me no like i'm going to keep going right and just you know i think again tony and others and everybody you know just holding their breath for for november and so when they get that meeting on the calendar with you know rosemary and others in november but that the i haven't figured out exactly how i want to leverage the what's it called the kind of like value proposition that and and i don't know i may add more to it but let me just drop that in the chat and in case it's easier to access it there greg thank you for all the comments in it i need to i mostly responded to the comments i'm still digesting them and i haven't really done a lot of work to go back into it this is my like i started to think like if i were tony and i was talking about this or arguing for this what would i need to be armed with in order to have a substantive conversation about this with someone else and so that's where this two pager kind of idea came from it's like this is what i would want if if i wasn't there this is what i would hope that others would say we were talking to like a board member talking to other people and so that's where this came from if there's something else i think like a way especially an opportunity if you see one you know in that you internet proposal like the the seven page proposal if i'm not addressing something else that's a bit of an elephant in the room in that proposal i i want to be able to address that in this value proposition document because the document itself is less important i think this language could be used in a slide deck or talking voice or something like that could be use a variety of ways so the only other thing i'll say is i haven't gotten anything else on tony's calendar but i think i'm going to reach out to his ea and just because that was our last text hey we should get something on the calendar so i'm going to reach out and see if i can't get something on the calendar and then for aps doing the same i've reached out to i think her name is candice to get on giles's calendar i have a feeling that both people are going to push me to like let's meet november which is fine like just tell me tell me no then tell me to pause tell me to stop and it might charter application thinking and planning i'm just i'm still i'm just still planning for both dps and aps at this point i thought this was really helpful and like i like how concise it is my concrete and two of arching costs one of which i alluded to in my email back to you justin but with one was and it's a i was like maybe we just don't know exactly yet but exactly what you were just saying i think it it seemed like sort of tweaks to what you've captured here and how it translates to a deck really depends on like all right who is the ultimate audience going to be and what do they need to hear like what are they and so i just wonder next time next time you do get a chance with tony if it makes sense to just ask that if the rest of the conversation is flowing along the path of course next steps of just asking the question directly but like if i'm going to hit four what if what is for audience x what is my what do they need to hear and i didn't have enough of a lens on who the audience would be or if we're thinking about general dps if there's stuff missing here but it might be just worth asking folks directly as you interact with them then the second thought which feels very down the road but it's just occurring to me as i'm reading this is i find this idea very exciting also has complexity super important to be successful in year one and so just like thinking through as as this idea is evolving all right what does this mean i need to be really good at in year one and am i still sort of defining a manageable set of things that i'm going to be able to nail into year one and then are there like that caveat maybe not the right word but like if this stuff that you're worried about like might take building boards are there with ways to sort of signal that early so that expertise are aligned so i was trying to read it with that lens and so just naming it as a i'm sure you're thinking about that but just like i think it's easy as we get down the sort of idea and sort of communicate with dps pathway to get a bunch on there and i think supporting occasionally revisit it they're like all right is there anything on here i feel like it's gonna be really hard to execute in your own thoughts yeah i love it like one thing that comes to mind you know that the complexity of the like the shared cross enrollment idea i don't i don't know and this is maybe something i would need to write somewhere i don't know that that's something that we would even leverage until probably year two right because the reason why a student from dps another school would want to leverage a pathway with us would be that's a specific pathway that goes into the right level of depth and i want to access that well we're we're not going to offer something like that until a year or two right until there's sophomores i mean in year one it's going to be three things it's going to be it's going to be culture it's going to be rigor and academics that the intervention specifically and it's going to be identity work that's it that's really it i mean without the identity work students are co designing and thinking about how their passions and their purpose align right so that's that is critical the culture when i mean by that is similar to what we've been talking about this call like the old culture and the culture of these pathways and how they're integrated i think that is going to be probably priority number one and then of course the academics the intervention quite frankly like catching kids up otherwise none of this matters if they're not caught up quickly none of this matters if it's not connected to who they are it doesn't matter it's just a normal school like any other and if the culture isn't there then this isn't different either so those are like the three things that we have to nail and they're kind of all venn diagram they kind of all you know connect together so it just it none of that is really sexy to be honest it might be i think it is i think it is right but if you look on the surface it's like well how is that innovative it's like it's incredibly innovative not a lot of schools do that well yeah so that makes a ton of sense and this is i think a little carp before the horse but i think the question is just as you get as you start having conversations with more of tony and green lights you'd be talking to a lot of folks are there any of those expectation management things that you just named that are important to try to be explicit about so you don't get to a place where someone's like wait a minute like i thought you were bringing in a bunch of dbs students who aren't in atlanta and you're want and then people i think down the road but just wanted to name it as think about as yeah your push is great generally on managing people's expectations are helpful so yeah thank you i was just gonna add two more quick thoughts on this and justin i think the document's awesome you know the what strikes me whether this is gonna work or not mvps is obviously politics which we have no control over but then the excitement around the vision and the meeting the unmet need and the second is you justin and so i actually i know this is not your nature but i think we need to like even on this talk about the work that you've been doing in ddps and with dps in the relational trust in the fact that you believe in dps winning and that's part of the difference in the third way approach that you're coming at this with and then i would go a little punch even a little stronger on the first chunk on vision from like an aspirational here's what's possible for our young people to like truly deliver like you now have that vision of that aviation school and it's like we don't have anything like this in denver okay bring that energy into the okay and related to that point justin i was thinking and the context that you shared about like hey ear what like this is the focus and like we are not talking about like hey industry and internships and like all those pieces like that is you'll start those conversations but like but just in this piece and to the point that lydia made about like aviation and like highlighting that i was just wondering like if there are like one or two partners who can stamp this or like industry partners who can stamp this which increases the weight in conversations with dps is that boeing said this or like going is aligned on this so like just those pieces of like if if not a formal partnership at least the their codes around the need part yeah yeah yeah even like as a quote in that two pager no as in like just generally i think you had highlighted right like the why aerospace and why now but yeah where you have quoted like what their projections are but like just making it more personal in terms of like hey they're head of dia or denver airport said diet or like again you are having those conversations i was just wondering like if they have shared like same need or same yeah they usually go a step further you know yeah bill usually goes separately like for an example i'll say you know like like deborah wilcox or something but because she's the chair for the colorado aerospace business roundtable her name comes up a lot and as she's very enthusiastic about this work she was just kind of one upping me the entire conversation like i would say well this statistic seems like this would be necessary she's like oh no it's greater than that there's a huge need and she would talk about like average age of you know an aerospace engineer is x and so yeah i think you're right and yeah it was just your feedback is like how do you punch this up right bunch this up and then just showing this plan as an endorsement from the industry yeah kind of creates more impact on your industry partnership vision yeah there's about to be a lot more of that happening this month with chris chavez so this is yeah i need to be gathering that in these conversations that would be easy to do love it okay great gosh i don't know how i think we're almost in time again let's see here the rest of the things i have on my list are more just like updates i think the main things we were able to get to yeah no one thing on the charter application stuff which yes you you all already gone back and forth on and i'm sure you've already on your radar justin but just naming that for each of the processes there's like a first step of either reaching out to somebody or attending trainings and all the websites have like the moment that the the updated timeline is going to be up there and all that kind of stuff probably already on your radar but just worth checking at some point again to make sure you know what the first step is in each place and when you want to do it like on dps's website for example it says you should reach out to the authorizing team if you're interested and it gives their email so now to jump in here if you have a point of view i'm not sure about the right timing is to do that like i think i might wait until after you've gotten some traction with tony to do that or whoever else but like just naming that there is that step so make sure you know what that step is in each place and can think about that all right when do i need to pull the trigger on that that's a really good point for aps it's really really fuzzy yeah i think for dps still fuzzy but again the criteria for the application is senior leadership co signing on this idea and there's a facility involved like ddps from a little bit more aligned with that with dps than with aps my sense with aps is that they are overwhelmed and they're already thinking about this comprehensive high school and dss t commingling is a facility even on the table i have no idea i have no idea part of me wonders if it is so what you're saying is just like take those start dates and take this like first steps into account with the plan yeah and just to name a lot my word is just there's always a risk in any of these things that you miss sort of a bureaucratic milestone right and then get into a reactive mode so just like and that is a make sure you're starting the processes at the appropriate time is a good way to make sure you're not missing us so that's all it's not a huge deal i just want to make sure there are no and just to note i was thinking like when you speak to alyssa like talk about them project managing some of these steps so that they are keeping a tab of all these key milestones or timelines that you need to meet in terms of submitting the charter okay great okay what am i forgetting i had one completely different question for you justin answer today but just to kind of put on your radar that i've been thinking about i'm wondering if the second half of this year is a good time to test anything that you've been wondering about or if you're thinking about doing that next fall but situanch and i were at a school that just opened this fall there's a very different model this week and they had the opportunity to really test for like a long period of time last year and learn so much that informed the ultimate model and it just it just made me think about that question for you and i feel like we have a lot of good partners who might be open to allowing you to do something you know what pieces of the model the ones you feel most that need to do that but just encourage you to think about that next twelve month period yeah i had originally planned to just even test some of the model ideas with like a group of kids just you know even yeah that's what i mean okay let me think about that some more okay and that might be like a summer like maybe that's like a next summer thing like it's summer program you can offer or you know anyway i think it'll come to you once you figure out what pieces of it are the ones that that you yeah i can tell you the first thing that comes to mind is even just testing what that agenda should be for the like summer bridge going into ninth grade i mean that that's something that people do very differently from place to place and that is that is something that i would probably test and i think we tested in the summer yeah that's good thank you i'm adding publicity here which may be the wrong idea but love that testing idea and presumably it's government getting traction on the unity idea summer you could test the summer bridge with dps in some ways and that might be a way to get really concrete collaboration on something the student centered early so that might make it harder to execute but might have some real dividends and building relationships and getting traction yeah justin sorry i love that craig last thought on this because i think i was supposed to introduce you to ann peakey at aps two which i can do if you want to meet with her it'll probably she'll probably want to wait till after the board election because she's running for reelection and it's crazy so i might honestly it may make sense to just wait a few weeks i think to make that introduction i think it's going to be highly unlikely aps is going to give you district space for this i just don't think it fits cleanly enough into their current plans and they're like a little wedded to their current plans right now the only other wondering i have is whether it's following back up with twenty seven j which who told me explicitly that they're going to have extra space in one of their high schools that's ten minutes from the airport just as like another i don't i'm like wary of like giving you too many political paths to try to start working on but at the same time i feel like it's like applying to college like we need a safety school you know i agree so anyway maybe think about that a little bit but that just might be one other something else worth thinking about do you think that's something that we should i keep thinking about this like kind of circling the wagons meeting in november that we were on that text thread about with rosemary is that something we bring into a conversation like that just like what are the what's the a path the beep have or is that a different conversation because i agree with you it's everything feels tenuous right and obviously it'll be more clear in november but it's not it's not a great strategy you just have to like this this unity proposal that i threw together for them like that's the path that feels very tenuous yeah i mean it feels pretty clear in my mind i don't know greg i respond to if you have thoughts that that the dps path is like by far the best one if we could figure it out for a myriad of reasons from the fact that that really is the airport district and like as you deep in partnerships there like that just as logical it makes sense they have this plan they don't have a plan they have the money the building they have the plan like there's just you have the relationship like i think ninety five percent of your energy honestly should be going on the dps route and that will include like the second we know who gets elected to the far northeast school board district you we want to make sure you're meeting with them you know all the all those things and so i think it might be maybe maybe as i'm talking it through maybe we just wait until i don't think we need to hash that out in the conversation with rosary but you and i could just get on the phone the day after the elections justin and be like okay well what does this do for game plan and then and then we could we can fire on the safety school twenty seven j introduction sounds good do you have it does that sound does that sound right to you yeah i think that all sounds right and justin the thing i'd be curious about honestly is given your relationship with tony like at what point is there a point in which you feel like you're getting a clear read from him on his like his confidence on the path because i like i think in my head that's a big part of like your relationship is a big part of why the dps path feels promising yeah it's really the only reason why this feels promising yeah so like i think it's worth just saying out loud like yeah like is there a point at which you you will know that you're getting a sort of ambiguous signal from tony and so because like he's and it's probably post election but just naming our label like testing with tony feels like a big gateway for increasing decreasing confidence and then yeah lydia the only thing i'd add to your point is it might be worth just looking quickly at twenty seven j timelines which i don't think is probably at all urgent but like the election hubbling after the election makes sense and then knowing all right if we do go the safety route what vvc be true by when in order to feel like we're kind of out passing yeah yeah i i mean from what i know about tony which it's turning out to be like actually i know a lot about somebody because it's been pretty accurate so far he's a pretty straight shooter type of person like he he doesn't like to kind of beat around the bush and so the positive signals that i'm getting from him like i trust those signals he would not be saying i mean he would just tell me like there's not a shot in hell just like just hold on he would tell me that you know i think you also there's like an inference that i'm making too that he and i both understand that he doesn't make those decision the board makes this decision so so much of it just really depends on what happens in the next couple of weeks yeah i mean it's it's making me think you know i i'm gonna reach out again to his ea i'll just text him and say hey like just follow me because in the last text thread we had it was like i think we need another meeting tony to just like talk about this and he was like yeah thumbs up so i think i'm just gonna follow up with like does it make sense for us to get together in the next couple of weeks or do you want to wait until november to to get together and talk about this some more in the meantime i have a two pager i'm working on to help any of us with language on how to like like position this isn't in a value proposition way i'm happy to send that to you just tell me what tell me what you think i'm does that i think this fish is the way you just described but you know tony adele but like i do think it would be a mistake to do any like push any false urgency if he's like wait so i'm not starting it needs to like rush it past like with whatever his pace it feels appropriate but just naming like you'll get a clear signal at some points here and then that will be really helpful and indicating great okay and lydia you mentioned when you talk to twenty seven j before if i remember correctly it was kind of like they were sort of like we've got this space but i think your read was like they both they don't know what they want or they're sophisticated kindly so yeah yeah we'd have to like really like walk through you know yes here's what this could look like etcetera justin the last thing how are you feeling about like actual family and student interest in the model yeah i've i i'm scheduled to have a meeting with families in early november i have a connection with the elk community center they do a lot of work with denver families just in engagement with families in the far north east i'm actually meeting with them next week it looks like next week i had my first meeting with them they've been very open to just like having family meetings there my my sense from folks i've been talking to matthew and then griselda this place is like it seems like a no brainer that families want this opportunity and it seems like it feels ironic to them that they see in the news that people complain about talent and they're like well we don't have access to that i i want i want feedback on the actual model itself right my worry and the one thing that i think is going to come up is this isn't a comprehensive high school model you know and so there is like you know families do want like some basic things out of high school they want safety they want strong academics and things like that but i'm also hearing that they you know what sports do we offer and things like that that can comprehensive high school would would offer and so i think there's going to be a i think there's going to be a sticking point there but i want to get more like of those trans meetings off the ground yeah and and i think justin has right to think about input into the model but i also think it's important to put on your like recruitment hat yeah like for this charter application to be approved and also for you to like have confidence that you're launching this school like you need to know that there are kids who are going to be signed up to you know who right now are seventh graders who are going to be your students right and start building that base of like literally thinking of it like a letters of intent how how are we tracking towards progress you probably already think about this but still offset like but but as you're starting this conversation i think it's worth trying to come out with all those conversations with list of names of the folks who were there and contact information but similar to sinatra's industry point like capture the quotes that you hear along the way because i'm sure those are going to be usable and then delete the letters of intent as appropriate but it's worth using every single family interaction i think with that recruitment hat on to build list of potential interested families good to see you as well sorry justin i feel like we were like just throwing a lot at you but super excited about where you are and all the all the inspiration you're taking from the schools that you've been visiting too it's awesome this is good this feels normal there's just a lot of things to focus on all at once and so that is that is i think that's just the normal path so appreciate this though thank you for all the ideas and the pushes really appreciate it awesome yeah chad is more stuff comes up even and we'll shift it to monthly but shot his stuff comes up on the phone",

raise another fund we're going to need something we need something yeah in the academic piece yeah that's true yeah and my guess is like even in the next years bloomberg's diligence we might have to present something share something later half of next year yeah it's almost making me wonder yeah i don't want to get too cute about it but i'm like do we need to add a school or two that these higher performing dsst will probably help us with some some of this but that's not going to open till twenty eight twenty eight yeah that's true my head was going was like a peak to peak you know that's only adding like sixty kids but i'm like why not i mean i don't want to get too i don't know i don't know i just i feel like we're doing good work and i don't want it to like i want to be honest about the data and i also don't want i don't want to like torpedo everything because the first round of schools that we bet on are all like the improvement schools you know that's where i had a question of like were these really improvements schools or or because like if if i just we put in the like they aren't in the two thirds out performing you know we said this metric of two thirds of the schools we support are going to be in the top third yeah maybe that was also the wrong metric by the way i think that was my that is my main question so for example lydia like if we if we support lotus we are already right there like we like that's the thing right like because lotus school for excellence it is already in the top third of the similar schools but when you look at the absolute proficiency you'll be like oh what what the hell is going on here yeah so again like i i don't know like how this because right now these are the top third schools we went through this list to figure out who is growing and who wants to grow so either these are like dsst some rocky mountain prep schools or they are like these single site schools that are not growing so so that is that is where like i think i think if i look at it like most of it is like the new schools that we are supporting our hope is that it will basically start with this and some of the schools are here which we want to move here i think that's the bet yeah yeah but i agree like how do we show the right balance in terms of framing that is something that yeah we'll have to spend more time yeah i got yeah we got to think about a little bit i mean we did also give talent grants to a number of those schools okay all right which like from dollar value standpoint was way more than what we gave these schools in this first year so yeah okay this is the other like school by school which i kind of broke down ela and math for each of those schools and again not a very specific signs but looking at these three questions around the absolute or like proficiency in growth similar schools ranking and gaps like i kind of did the red yellow green for them based on which i think there are some bright spots here but otherwise it's which is reflected in the two by two also is is around the gaps so we can discuss each of the schools but this is just the next update from like a last discussion on how schools are performing individually yeah my slight amendment to this suit i'm sure might be for a k i mean their growth is really impressive and i still don't understand yeah that yeah so i wouldn't put them as red if they have my red was basically it was like down from last year and that's why it was red but yeah i i agree i think probably my to be determined the why behind this yeah okay introd for these calls are we pulling yeah so basically like whatever the dashboards that we have from cmas like the views that we are looking at wanted to make it transparent for them and share it so grounding in like how we look at the data especially similar school rank and like some of the growth data because again like everyone you talk to like it they will always start with like we are green on spf like that's the that's the single thing that i hear keying yesterday also i was talking to some new school leader and they were like yeah we are green for last three years four years and when i pulled their data on similar school rank they were in like bottom ten twelve fifteen percent so i was like okay so yeah that's the ideal area for each of those conversations wanted to share based on the data you shared like these are the views we have pulled and like let's anchor on our milestones were like to be in the top third like let's talk through like what would it take to i think it'd be helpful i guess we prepare for those conversations to just literally have what we're going to share with them for you and mita just align you know just make sure we're clear on who's communicating what message yeah yeah so i will have all those slides up i have already started putting together but next week there's only one call in rest of those are week after so for a k i've already put them together we can talk through that the other thing was like on the enrollment side i basically did like how they adjusted their budget but i think for me most most important was like what we had underwritten and how they're performing against that so for example yeah james irvin like by year two it should be two hundred fifty seats they are at one hundred thirty nine which is significantly below and then aak chose around three hundred ten and they are at two hundred thirty three again both of those have adjusted their budgets but am i bigger thing is like long term sustainability because these are in private facilities others have done pretty well with yeah others are all on track on enrollment that's exciting so for that conversation wanted to bring this up too of like the why and like paths to get back on track i'm most worried i would actually worried about both the schools in terms of like enrollment system or like financial sustainability long term they might have like some buffer to get through next couple of years but like it has to come back on track let's start with james irvin so rob is funny so he just responds to one part of the of the email and doesn't respond to the rest so he forwarded my email to someone in the team to upload the data or like share the data but didn't respond to the meeting invite so still i copied you on my response to that as well i'm also wondering i mean i could also sit down with him in the springs october twenty seventh if that's better although we probably should pull up get on the call so let me see this on monday yeah can we offer any more windows and i can come back on top of it this is just for rob yeah just for robin then what we discussed was that christy is going to connect with yeah christy is going to connect with carrie okay and are we looking for a thirty minute zoom call yeah so you said should i respond to that and offer more windows no i'm going to respond to elevate it and but i want to add in a couple windows next week yeah you can do it next week or even week after i have hold on your calendars yeah that's what i'm just going to add those is what i was saying so you said twelve fourteen or twelve sixteen okay twelve okay and then the other whole time it's the twenty second yeah yeah let me one to three pm the other whole time is yeah twenty yeah that twenty second block okay set okay i'm just gonna grab a little lunch while we're talking i might just yeah video for a second this is i think like a k is the next one this is we are connecting with nicole next week on sixteenth today i think here we probably might have to have like more direct conversation one was like yeah we we will share the academic analysis we'll talk through that but i think like here the challenge is more around like both enrollment and others so again like nicole has shared that like last year her capacity was the challenge but like my guess is there is more why beneath that so wanted to understand that better and then the other thing was like you and christy had discussed to visit sometime in november so just leave it like want to make sure we communicate that to have a follow up meeting with christy deep diving into their data yeah yeah i think sinatra might wondering is what are the benchmark what do we want to see like they are one where we probably want to stay a lot closer this year wouldn't we want to see by when on the annual front for next year to give us confidence and we should probably also signal that our grant for next fall or be at risk if we don't see significant improvement yeah so i think there are two thirty three and will be going after next so sorry can you say more on like the benchmark for enrollment it seems like their challenge this year is they just started focusing on it way too late yeah it's actually this time of year when you need to be doing your big effort on enrollment and so like we may want to track more interim data on there either us or are they working with vanessa like what are we basically saying like needs to be true is that they maybe find like the they need to hit a stronger number earlier yeah earlier than they did last year yeah so i guess like yeah so like i think the two matrix that they will be closely i mean they should be closely tracking which i know at least from my conversation with vanessa was like the number of new leads and then basically ak's role is to be to continue to follow up with them to convert but lydia i think on the enrollment side they'll continue to generate leads from now till may but like most of the conversions actually happen after may next year so i'm curious i don't know if you'll know we'll have like confirmed enrollments per se before april may next year that seems really late to me i think we can have like the benchmarks for like the number of confirmations by march by april and by may so that like we know how things are tracking there earlier than that i'd be really curious to understand i mean you know each community is a little different in terms of when parents are enrolling and everything school choice is happening in denver this fall like parents are making decisions now about where their kids are going to be at school next year i don't know exactly what it looks like in fort collins and who their competitors are but it might be helpful i'm almost wondering if we could get a sense of this from like jenny at access like what time of year they have parents commit and everything but may is way too late i would imagine it would be more like january february but i don't you know if the competing is private schools that's usually in the fall i don't know based on the last year cycle i think they were tracking more conversions like in in like the spring months not not this fall like denver might be different but i think that's what i'm saying didn't work it was too late okay that way yeah i can check with jenny in terms of like when is there majority of their new enrollments happen just what's the time of year your parents are making decisions know when did the other choice schools have big pushes on enrollment you know okay so we can we can again i can i can connect with vanessa before and then i can also check with jenny because i'm meeting her on fifteenth so i'll i'll know more about fort collins and like that dynamics there but we can bring this up in terms of like getting clarity much earlier like january february time frame to understand how enrollment is planning for the next year sirha the fort collins global district i just looked at their website it's does the school choice portal opens the first run is november third through december fifteenth the second round is january to may yeah and that is first choice like in a month but like aek is not part of that right they're not part of it but that's a really important timeline for what most parents in the district are anchoring on when they're choosing schools yeah stop sharing yeah so they basically said that enrollment for twenty six twenty seven school year begins in on november first for for ak but i think most of the conversions happen pretty late last year we can talk more about this with them but my sense is that the big part of that challenge is their timeline is way off then rest of the market for their big push and everything you know oh my god what happened website they got there's one thing they need to i'm not just on their website which is not working which section they have a thing that says our tuition can be found here but they mean that for their pre k program not their whole program but it's not clear like are they offering tours this fall like they don't have that on their website they should be offering weekly tours right now i don't know there just seems like there's like a lot of things they might need help with i don't know you know anyway i don't want to get too lagged down the reads on this but they need help i think they need help yeah so i think like the core question is because again in this part also like vanessa had suggested lot of website updates to this and like firmly experience standpoint also which again a kid in implement so i'm i'm trying to figure out like is this more of the execution issue or like is it like the support that vanessa is getting is not working here well let's just ask her when we talk next week yeah okay so two things one is like just understanding under the hood of like how or the why and how behind the enrollment and getting the clarity on like by when they will know how it's trending for the next year hopefully by next january we'll have more data from them and then the on the academic side lydia again this is their data terms of two by two but their growth is high so i was curious on like just the framing for this like should we leave it at like would like to understand more around this data i'd be curious for hypothesis on the disconnect between the two yeah and then i just want to introduce this i don't know how much time we've spent with her on this view you know so just want to like help her really internalize it in an ideal world this is where you know you'd be i don't know why sandra why are some of these ray and some so the color colored are all charter schools like the dark ones okay and then the dark blue are top third light like this blue is in middle and then gray are all bottom third okay is there a way to not have the charter filter on there because i think it i think it's simpler if it's just all schools and you see the top third do you know what i mean yeah i can i can i can remove that i actually did it yes if i change it no it will show all schools i think that'll just be easier to explain like digest for her okay okay so i would just say i think over time we want to see you definitely in the middle third and ideally in the top third what other support do you need and then also tee up this idea of you know coming to visit and yeah doing a deeper dive of the data yeah so let's just spend time on just this this two by two i mean because i had pulled together all data but it'll be too much to bring up and i don't know there are other main takeaways other than this slide yeah i think that's smart we can have chris to go into the details yeah and i can yeah we can share that as a follow up but like this one is something we can spend time on okay so enrollment and this slide i think this is one where overall performance is okay it's just going from good to great there two by two is here on the line and slightly above the line in ela you know yeah yeah i think just spending time on two by two i think enrollment wise they're fine yeah nothing wasn't student group gap like oh yeah that might be the other one we use with them it's just like this continues to be something we're monitoring and really want to see improve yeah i think that yeah that is the one it's much more it's significantly high yeah so i think i'll i'll pull this view as well for them it is twenty five percent gap here yeah same with crown point leader y ep linear heritage heights we don't have the call schedule but i think you and i had discussed like i will pull the views for them which can be helpful for their charter and then you said later in fall you might have conversation with natalia to same sharing these views so maybe we try to do it but soon onto the next few weeks before you go just the same thing you know we just again here's how we look at it here's what's important to us what would it take for you all to get to this top third yeah i think they have the best bet of getting there of anyone that's true in this group so i think we should have that conversation we can just do it over zoom okay so i'll reach out to her and schedule that time there okay i'm glad i have those blocks on your calendar but still holds are still there i love her time well i changed my you know the fact that i canceled my trip on the twenty eighth is going to be very helpful for everything yeah uprep we are visiting there it was just pre k and i think literacy is the big open question here again here like the tricky part is like should we just look at the commerce city data or the network because commercially data is we don't have much there we're just looking at conversity for you know like our accountability purposes yeah but from a from a how do we make sure they're operating in a strong way and have a good solid yellow program that's why we're visiting steel and looking at the network okay yeah so i don't think like i have like again i can just pull like up network views if you want to share the data so i think that will be helpful for the conversation yeah i think so too kelly we are we are connecting very limited data all over the place nothing concrete yet so connecting with her to one like understand how they are tracking the data because when i looked at their dash board the data that they have submitted is also like all over the place so we have dibels data but like other nwa map data is like very limited n size is eight and like hard to interpret anything can we see any difference between grain junction and aurora we don't even it's too small to even have any yeah pretty small i can check but steve if we can separate it out because the the challenge yeah i think we'll have i'll have to work with steve to do it more because i think they coded by by whatever each site is a different name and then when you break it down by that it becomes like even like n size becomes even more small so every percentage so because they don't tag it as aurora or grand valley it's just the site name so i might have to figure out with steve like is there a way to do that on the back end to just say aurora all the sites in aurora and all the sites in grand junction or one site in grand junction pull up the data does this have an n size on it anywhere like yeah yeah okay for each grade but it's across eighteen across all sites no yeah why are these numbers so low doesn't make sense to me which one any of them because their third grade is only in aurora there was no third grade book eighteen they only have eighteen kindergartners across both classes i guess that might be right jeez yeah that's the one wildflower this year so this is twenty eight this year so last year yeah i think should be fine so this is like their grade level enroll i would just really like to hear them actually like i don't think they actually believe in data or i don't think rachel believes in data i just want you to like ask them what are they learning from it what are they change like little interrogate a little bit almost you know yeah yeah okay still hold up to get them off to see libertas in memphis at some point and then lady hierarchies can you remind me what we discussed with laurel and laura on connecting with christy initial i was trying to recollect and i remember we told them that we'll make the connection was it more around the literacy program well i think we said we were going to check with christy on the leather there was anyone it was around the fluid sea question right i wrote it down hold on is there any targeted fluency support in phonics for kids that they actually enjoy that was the question okay so this is it i'll prepare materials for each of those conversations in the agenda thank you and then do a little bit more thinking and we can discuss more next week on rolling up this data for the board for the board yeah let's do know for the board we should have all the schools that are open and maybe like an on track to opening for the ones we've invested that are not don't have data yet you know just kind of how they're trending in these areas i don't know and i think i think a regular green plus like two bullets for each is fine okay two bullets per school or three bullets per school overall you know it doesn't need to be overly i don't think we need to be like overly sharing a bajillion things yeah yeah okay i'm envisioning like one page or one slide one slide for the portfolio yeah yeah okay sounds thanks for all the work on this too yeah no this was helpful as i was like pulling all this data i was like yeah this is like i think it'll be helpful to anchor or like ask the right questions now so that and then lydia we have before i leave i think we have the one hour with greg to follow up on like what we had conversation around our portfolio management strategy or philosophy so we have a follow up on that in the next steps i think he was more of like hey this is the project plan and we discussed about interviewing school leaders i was like okay probably like after this round of data collection i think we should reflect on some of the questions we discussed and how we want to approach yeah yeah so we have that time too before i leave there were other quick things norwood meeting rich said he can join so i'll respond to eric and we'll share the zoom invite for everyone then did you see email from sarah about ste i just saw it yeah yeah so aaron emailed me this morning saying that hey do you have other denver schools you're working with for this the two potentials we two potential we had discussed were odyssey you had said they should open the middle school there and then the other one was magic school case they have to go private facility is it ok if i schedule like a follow up call with him would you like to join yeah i thought you already had reached out yeah but he specifically reached out about denver i reached out indian respond but probably this news kind of made him ok so i'll do that once you go to school in that space i think suhachu we should do know do you remember how much their rent is because they'll be a gap year if it's magic school yeah there will be a gap year i need to double check on the rent i can double check i have the numbers i worked with their board regular to pull that number i think there were two parts to it one was like their actual school rent was pretty low but this common area rent or cam that they were paying because it was for the whole property which made it slightly high so we can negotiate like probably just holding the facility by paying the school rent not the common area rent yeah that could be one thing we can discuss but i'll pull the numbers like what exactly how much it was exactly ok this one we discussed dan said that yahi would be happy to have conversation around mnr and you had suggested i'm just trying to figure out in the next two weeks where should i put this in the priority no i think i actually talked to him today because i was on my way to meet tomi from kip and i was like can you give me examples of you know such and such scenario because i thought she was going to talk about rocky mountain prep which she needs to talk about at all ok i don't i don't know what's going on there hey sudha do you mind if we switch to the phone yeah let's do this yeah sure",

looking for a thirty minute zoom call yeah so you said should i respond to that and offer more windows no i'm going to respond to elevate it and but i want to add in a couple windows next week yeah you can do it next week or even week after i have hold on your calendars yeah that's what i'm just going to add those is what i was saying so you said twelve fourteen or twelve sixteen okay twelve okay and then the other whole time it's the twenty second yeah yeah let me one to three pm the other whole time is yeah twenty yeah that twenty second block okay set okay i'm just gonna grab a little lunch while we're talking i might just yeah video for a second this is i think like a k is the next one this is we are connecting with nicole next week on sixteenth today i think here we probably might have to have like more direct conversation one was like yeah we we will share the academic analysis we'll talk through that but i think like here the challenge is more around like both enrollment and others so again like nicole has shared that like last year her capacity was the challenge but like my guess is there is more why beneath that so wanted to understand that better and then the other thing was like you and christy had discussed to visit sometime in november so just leave it like want to make sure we communicate that to have a follow up meeting with christy deep diving into their data yeah yeah i think sinatra might wondering is what are the benchmark what do we want to see like they are one where we probably want to stay a lot closer this year wouldn't we want to see by when on the annual front for next year to give us confidence and we should probably also signal that our grant for next fall or be at risk if we don't see significant improvement yeah so i think there are two thirty three and will be going after next so sorry can you say more on like the benchmark for enrollment it seems like their challenge this year is they just started focusing on it way too late yeah it's actually this time of year when you need to be doing your big effort on enrollment and so like we may want to track more interim data on there either us or are they working with vanessa like what are we basically saying like needs to be true is that they maybe find like the they need to hit a stronger number earlier yeah earlier than they did last year yeah so i guess like yeah so like i think the two matrix that they will be closely i mean they should be closely tracking which i know at least from my conversation with vanessa was like the number of new leads and then basically ak's role is to be to continue to follow up with them to convert but lydia i think on the enrollment side they'll continue to generate leads from now till may but like most of the conversions actually happen after may next year so i'm curious i don't know if you'll know we'll have like confirmed enrollments per se before april may next year that seems really late to me i think we can have like the benchmarks for like the number of confirmations by march by april and by may so that like we know how things are tracking there earlier than that i'd be really curious to understand i mean you know each community is a little different in terms of when parents are enrolling and everything school choice is happening in denver this fall like parents are making decisions now about where their kids are going to be at school next year i don't know exactly what it looks like in fort collins and who their competitors are but it might be helpful i'm almost wondering if we could get a sense of this from like jenny at access like what time of year they have parents commit and everything but may is way too late i would imagine it would be more like january february but i don't you know if the competing is private schools that's usually in the fall i don't know based on the last year cycle i think they were tracking more conversions like in in like the spring months not not this fall like denver might be different but i think that's what i'm saying didn't work it was too late okay that way yeah i can check with jenny in terms of like when is there majority of their new enrollments happen just what's the time of year your parents are making decisions know when did the other choice schools have big pushes on enrollment you know okay so we can we can again i can i can connect with vanessa before and then i can also check with jenny because i'm meeting her on fifteenth so i'll i'll know more about fort collins and like that dynamics there but we can bring this up in terms of like getting clarity much earlier like january february time frame to understand how enrollment is planning for the next year sirha the fort collins global district i just looked at their website it's does the school choice portal opens the first run is november third through december fifteenth the second round is january to may yeah and that is first choice like in a month but like aek is not part of that right they're not part of it but that's a really important timeline for what most parents in the district are anchoring on when they're choosing schools yeah stop sharing yeah so they basically said that enrollment for twenty six twenty seven school year begins in on november first for for ak but i think most of the conversions happen pretty late last year we can talk more about this with them but my sense is that the big part of that challenge is their timeline is way off then rest of the market for their big push and everything you know oh my god what happened website they got there's one thing they need to i'm not just on their website which is not working which section they have a thing that says our tuition can be found here but they mean that for their pre k program not their whole program but it's not clear like are they offering tours this fall like they don't have that on their website they should be offering weekly tours right now i don't know there just seems like there's like a lot of things they might need help with i don't know you know anyway i don't want to get too lagged down the reads on this but they need help i think they need help yeah so i think like the core question is because again in this part also like vanessa had suggested lot of website updates to this and like firmly experience standpoint also which again a kid in implement so i'm i'm trying to figure out like is this more of the execution issue or like is it like the support that vanessa is getting is not working here well let's just ask her when we talk next week yeah okay so two things one is like just understanding under the hood of like how or the why and how behind the enrollment and getting the clarity on like by when they will know how it's trending for the next year hopefully by next january we'll have more data from them and then the on the academic side lydia again this is their data terms of two by two but their growth is high so i was curious on like just the framing for this like should we leave it at like would like to understand more around this data i'd be curious for hypothesis on the disconnect between the two yeah and then i just want to introduce this i don't know how much time we've spent with her on this view you know so just want to like help her really internalize it in an ideal world this is where you know you'd be i don't know why sandra why are some of these ray and some so the color colored are all charter schools like the dark ones okay and then the dark blue are top third light like this blue is in middle and then gray are all bottom third okay is there a way to not have the charter filter on there because i think it i think it's simpler if it's just all schools and you see the top third do you know what i mean yeah i can i can i can remove that i actually did it yes if i change it no it will show all schools i think that'll just be easier to explain like digest for her okay okay so i would just say i think over time we want to see you definitely in the middle third and ideally in the top third what other support do you need and then also tee up this idea of you know coming to visit and yeah doing a deeper dive of the data yeah so let's just spend time on just this this two by two i mean because i had pulled together all data but it'll be too much to bring up and i don't know there are other main takeaways other than this slide yeah i think that's smart we can have chris to go into the details yeah and i can yeah we can share that as a follow up but like this one is something we can spend time on okay so enrollment and this slide i think this is one where overall performance is okay it's just going from good to great there two by two is here on the line and slightly above the line in ela you know yeah yeah i think just spending time on two by two i think enrollment wise they're fine yeah nothing wasn't student group gap like oh yeah that might be the other one we use with them it's just like this continues to be something we're monitoring and really want to see improve yeah i think that yeah that is the one it's much more it's significantly high yeah so i think i'll i'll pull this view as well for them it is twenty five percent gap here yeah same with crown point leader y ep linear heritage heights we don't have the call schedule but i think you and i had discussed like i will pull the views for them which can be helpful for their charter and then you said later in fall you might have conversation with natalia to same sharing these views so maybe we try to do it but soon onto the next few weeks before you go just the same thing you know we just again here's how we look at it here's what's important to us what would it take for you all to get to this top third yeah i think they have the best bet of getting there of anyone that's true in this group so i think we should have that conversation we can just do it over zoom okay so i'll reach out to her and schedule that time there okay i'm glad i have those blocks on your calendar but still holds are still there i love her time well i changed my you know the fact that i canceled my trip on the twenty eighth is going to be very helpful for everything yeah uprep we are visiting there it was just pre k and i think literacy is the big open question here again here like the tricky part is like should we just look at the commerce city data or the network because commercially data is we don't have much there we're just looking at conversity for you know like our accountability purposes yeah but from a from a how do we make sure they're operating in a strong way and have a good solid yellow program that's why we're visiting steel and looking at the network okay yeah so i don't think like i have like again i can just pull like up network views if you want to share the data so i think that will be helpful for the conversation yeah i think so too kelly we are we are connecting very limited data all over the place nothing concrete yet so connecting with her to one like understand how they are tracking the data because when i looked at their dash board the data that they have submitted is also like all over the place so we have dibels data but like other nwa map data is like very limited n size is eight and like hard to interpret anything can we see any difference between grain junction and aurora we don't even it's too small to even have any yeah pretty small i can check but steve if we can separate it out because the the challenge yeah i think we'll have i'll have to work with steve to do it more because i think they coded by by whatever each site is a different name and then when you break it down by that it becomes like even like n size becomes even more small so every percentage so because they don't tag it as aurora or grand valley it's just the site name so i might have to figure out with steve like is there a way to do that on the back end to just say aurora all the sites in aurora and all the sites in grand junction or one site in grand junction pull up the data does this have an n size on it anywhere like yeah yeah okay for each grade but it's across eighteen across all sites no yeah why are these numbers so low doesn't make sense to me which one any of them because their third grade is only in aurora there was no third grade book eighteen they only have eighteen kindergartners across both classes i guess that might be right jeez yeah that's the one wildflower this year so this is twenty eight this year so last year yeah i think should be fine so this is like their grade level enroll i would just really like to hear them actually like i don't think they actually believe in data or i don't think rachel believes in data i just want you to like ask them what are they learning from it what are they change like little interrogate a little bit almost you know yeah yeah okay still hold up to get them off to see libertas in memphis at some point and then lady hierarchies can you remind me what we discussed with laurel and laura on connecting with christy initial i was trying to recollect and i remember we told them that we'll make the connection was it more around the literacy program well i think we said we were going to check with christy on the leather there was anyone it was around the fluid sea question right i wrote it down hold on is there any targeted fluency support in phonics for kids that they actually enjoy that was the question okay so this is it i'll prepare materials for each of those conversations in the agenda thank you and then do a little bit more thinking and we can discuss more next week on rolling up this data for the board for the board yeah let's do know for the board we should have all the schools that are open and maybe like an on track to opening for the ones we've invested that are not don't have data yet you know just kind of how they're trending in these areas i don't know and i think i think a regular green plus like two bullets for each is fine okay two bullets per school or three bullets per school overall you know it doesn't need to be overly i don't think we need to be like overly sharing a bajillion things yeah yeah okay i'm envisioning like one page or one slide one slide for the portfolio yeah yeah okay sounds thanks for all the work on this too yeah no this was helpful as i was like pulling all this data i was like yeah this is like i think it'll be helpful to anchor or like ask the right questions now so that and then lydia we have before i leave i think we have the one hour with greg to follow up on like what we had conversation around our portfolio management strategy or philosophy so we have a follow up on that in the next steps i think he was more of like hey this is the project plan and we discussed about interviewing school leaders i was like okay probably like after this round of data collection i think we should reflect on some of the questions we discussed and how we want to approach yeah yeah so we have that time too before i leave there were other quick things norwood meeting rich said he can join so i'll respond to eric and we'll share the zoom invite for everyone then did you see email from sarah about ste i just saw it yeah yeah so aaron emailed me this morning saying that hey do you have other denver schools you're working with for this the two potentials we two potential we had discussed were odyssey you had said they should open the middle school there and then the other one was magic school case they have to go private facility is it ok if i schedule like a follow up call with him would you like to join yeah i thought you already had reached out yeah but he specifically reached out about denver i reached out indian respond but probably this news kind of made him ok so i'll do that once you go to school in that space i think suhachu we should do know do you remember how much their rent is because they'll be a gap year if it's magic school yeah there will be a gap year i need to double check on the rent i can double check i have the numbers i worked with their board regular to pull that number i think there were two parts to it one was like their actual school rent was pretty low but this common area rent or cam that they were paying because it was for the whole property which made it slightly high so we can negotiate like probably just holding the facility by paying the school rent not the common area rent yeah that could be one thing we can discuss but i'll pull the numbers like what exactly how much it was exactly ok this one we discussed dan said that yahi would be happy to have conversation around mnr and you had suggested i'm just trying to figure out in the next two weeks where should i put this in the priority no i think i actually talked to him today because i was on my way to meet tomi from kip and i was like can you give me examples of you know such and such scenario because i thought she was going to talk about rocky mountain prep which she needs to talk about at all ok i don't i don't know what's going on there hey sudha do you mind if we switch to the phone yeah let's do this yeah sure",

        "summary": "early data might not be straightforward right because like east hills spruce like they are only starting with kindergarten yeah or maybe the reality is by the time we even go to raise another fund we're going to need something we need something yeah in the academic piece yeah that's true yeah and my guess is like even in the next years bloomberg's diligence we might have to present something share something later half of next year yeah it's almost making me wonder yeah i don't want to get too cute about it but i'm like do we need to add a school or two that these higher performing dsst will probably help us with some some of this but that's not going to open till twenty eight twenty eight yeah that's true my head was going was like a peak to peak you know that's only adding like sixty kids but i'm like why not i mean i don't want to get too i don't know i don't know i just i feel like we're doing good work and i don't want it to like i want to be honest about the data and i also don't want i don't want to like torpedo everything because the first round of schools that we bet on are all like the improvement schools you know that's where i had a question of like were these really improvements schools or or because like if if i just we put in the like they aren't in the two thirds out performing you know we said this metric of two thirds of the schools we support are going to be in the top third yeah maybe that was also the wrong metric by the way i think that was my that is my main question so for example lydia like if we if we support lotus we are already right there like we like that's the thing right like because lotus school for excellence it is already in the top third of the similar schools but when you look at the absolute proficiency you'll be like oh what what the hell is going on here yeah so again like i i don't know like how this because right now these are the top third schools we went through this list to figure out who is growing and who wants to grow so either these are like dsst some rocky mountain prep schools or they are like these single site schools that are not growing so so that is that is where like i think i think if i look at it like most of it is like the new schools that we are supporting our hope is that it will basically start with this and some of the schools are here which we want to move here i think that's the bet yeah yeah but i agree like how do we show the right balance in terms of framing that is something that yeah we'll have to spend more time yeah i got yeah we got to think about a little bit i mean we did also give talent grants to a number of those schools okay all right which like from dollar value standpoint was way more than what we gave these schools in this first year so yeah okay this is the other like school by school which i kind of broke down ela and math for each of those schools and again not a very specific signs but looking at these three questions around the absolute or like proficiency in growth similar schools ranking and gaps like i kind of did the red yellow green for them based on which i think there are some bright spots here but otherwise it's which is reflected in the two by two also is is around the gaps so we can discuss each of the schools but this is just the next update from like a last discussion on how schools are performing individually yeah my slight amendment to this suit i'm sure might be for a k i mean their growth is really impressive and i still don't understand yeah that yeah so i wouldn't put them as red if they have my red was basically it was like down from last year and that's why it was red but yeah i i agree i think probably my to be determined the why behind this yeah okay introd for these calls are we pulling yeah so basically like whatever the dashboards that we have from cmas like the views that we are looking at wanted to make it transparent for them and share it so grounding in like how we look at the data especially similar school rank and like some of the growth data because again like everyone you talk to like it they will always start with like we are green on spf like that's the that's the single thing that i hear keying yesterday also i was talking to some new school leader and they were like yeah we are green for last three years four years and when i pulled their data on similar school rank they were in like bottom ten twelve fifteen percent so i was like okay so yeah that's the ideal area for each of those conversations wanted to share based on the data you shared like these are the views we have pulled and like let's anchor on our milestones were like to be in the top third like let's talk through like what would it take to i think it'd be helpful i guess we prepare for those conversations to just literally have what we're going to share with them for you and mita just align you know just make sure we're clear on who's communicating what message yeah yeah so i will have all those slides up i have already started putting together but next week there's only one call in rest of those are week after so for a k i've already put them together we can talk through that the other thing was like on the enrollment side i basically did like how they adjusted their budget but i think for me most most important was like what we had underwritten and how they're performing against that so for example yeah james irvin like by year two it should be two hundred fifty seats they are at one hundred thirty nine which is significantly below and then aak chose around three hundred ten and they are at two hundred thirty three again both of those have adjusted their budgets but am i bigger thing is like long term sustainability because these are in private facilities others have done pretty well with yeah others are all on track on enrollment that's exciting so for that conversation wanted to bring this up too of like the why and like paths to get back on track i'm most worried i would actually worried about both the schools in terms of like enrollment system or like financial sustainability long term they might have like some buffer to get through next couple of years but like it has to come back on track let's start with james irvin so rob is funny so he just responds to one part of the of the email and doesn't respond to the rest so he forwarded my email to someone in the team to upload the data or like share the data but didn't respond to the meeting invite so still i copied you on my response to that as well i'm also wondering i mean i could also sit down with him in the springs october twenty seventh if that's better although we probably should pull up get on the call so let me see this on monday yeah can we offer any more windows and i can come back on top of it this is just for rob yeah just for robin then what we discussed was that christy is going to connect with yeah christy is going to connect with carrie okay and are we looking for a thirty minute zoom call yeah so you said should i respond to that and offer more windows no i'm going to respond to elevate it and but i want to add in a couple windows next week yeah you can do it next week or even week after i have hold on your calendars yeah that's what i'm just going to add those is what i was saying so you said twelve fourteen or twelve sixteen okay twelve okay and then the other whole time it's the twenty second yeah yeah let me one to three pm the other whole time is yeah twenty yeah that twenty second block okay set okay i'm just gonna grab a little lunch while we're talking i might just yeah video for a second this is i think like a k is the next one this is we are connecting with nicole next week on sixteenth today i think here we probably might have to have like more direct conversation one was like yeah we we will share the academic analysis we'll talk through that but i think like here the challenge is more around like both enrollment and others so again like nicole has shared that like last year her capacity was the challenge but like my guess is there is more why beneath that so wanted to understand that better and then the other thing was like you and christy had discussed to visit sometime in november so just leave it like want to make sure we communicate that to have a follow up meeting with christy deep diving into their data yeah yeah i think sinatra might wondering is what are the benchmark what do we want to see like they are one where we probably want to stay a lot closer this year wouldn't we want to see by when on the annual front for next year to give us confidence and we should probably also signal that our grant for next fall or be at risk if we don't see significant improvement yeah so i think there are two thirty three and will be going after next so sorry can you say more on like the benchmark for enrollment it seems like their challenge this year is they just started focusing on it way too late yeah it's actually this time of year when you need to be doing your big effort on enrollment and so like we may want to track more interim data on there either us or are they working with vanessa like what are we basically saying like needs to be true is that they maybe find like the they need to hit a stronger number earlier yeah earlier than they did last year yeah so i

that they have submitted is also like all over the place so we have dibels data but like other nwa map data is like very limited n size is eight and like hard to interpret anything can we see any difference between grain junction and aurora we don't even it's too small to even have any yeah pretty small i can check but steve if we can separate it out because the the challenge yeah i think we'll have i'll have to work with steve to do it more because i think they coded by by whatever each site is a different name and then when you break it down by that it becomes like even like n size becomes even more small so every percentage so because they don't tag it as aurora or grand valley it's just the site name so i might have to figure out with steve like is there a way to do that on the back end to just say aurora all the sites in aurora and all the sites in grand junction or one site in grand junction pull up the data does this have an n size on it anywhere like yeah yeah okay for each grade but it's across eighteen across all sites no yeah why are these numbers so low doesn't make sense to me which one any of them because their third grade is only in aurora there was no third grade book eighteen they only have eighteen kindergartners across both classes i guess that might be right jeez yeah that's the one wildflower this year so this is twenty eight this year so last year yeah i think should be fine so this is like their grade level enroll i would just really like to hear them actually like i don't think they actually believe in data or i don't think rachel believes in data i just want you to like ask them what are they learning from it what are they change like little interrogate a little bit almost you know yeah yeah okay still hold up to get them off to see libertas in memphis at some point and then lady hierarchies can you remind me what we discussed with laurel and laura on connecting with christy initial i was trying to recollect and i remember we told them that we'll make the connection was it more around the literacy program well i think we said we were going to check with christy on the leather there was anyone it was around the fluid sea question right i wrote it down hold on is there any targeted fluency support in phonics for kids that they actually enjoy that was the question okay so this is it i'll prepare materials for each of those conversations in the agenda thank you and then do a little bit more thinking and we can discuss more next week on rolling up this data for the board for the board yeah let's do know for the board we should have all the schools that are open and maybe like an on track to opening for the ones we've invested that are not don't have data yet you know just kind of how they're trending in these areas i don't know and i think i think a regular green plus like two bullets for each is fine okay two bullets per school or three bullets per school overall you know it doesn't need to be overly i don't think we need to be like overly sharing a bajillion things yeah yeah okay i'm envisioning like one page or one slide one slide for the portfolio yeah yeah okay sounds thanks for all the work on this too yeah no this was helpful as i was like pulling all this data i was like yeah this is like i think it'll be helpful to anchor or like ask the right questions now so that and then lydia we have before i leave i think we have the one hour with greg to follow up on like what we had conversation around our portfolio management strategy or philosophy so we have a follow up on that in the next steps i think he was more of like hey this is the project plan and we discussed about interviewing school leaders i was like okay probably like after this round of data collection i think we should reflect on some of the questions we discussed and how we want to approach yeah yeah so we have that time too before i leave there were other quick things norwood meeting rich said he can join so i'll respond to eric and we'll share the zoom invite for everyone then did you see email from sarah about ste i just saw it yeah yeah so aaron emailed me this morning saying that hey do you have other denver schools you're working with for this the two potentials we two potential we had discussed were odyssey you had said they should open the middle school there and then the other one was magic school case they have to go private facility is it ok if i schedule like a follow up call with him would you like to join yeah i thought you already had reached out yeah but he specifically reached out about denver i reached out indian respond but probably this news kind of made him ok so i'll do that once you go to school in that space i think suhachu we should do know do you remember how much their rent is because they'll be a gap year if it's magic school yeah there will be a gap year i need to double check on the rent i can double check i have the numbers i worked with their board regular to pull that number i think there were two parts to it one was like their actual school rent was pretty low but this common area rent or cam that they were paying because it was for the whole property which made it slightly high so we can negotiate like probably just holding the facility by paying the school rent not the common area rent yeah that could be one thing we can discuss but i'll pull the numbers like what exactly how much it was exactly ok this one we discussed dan said that yahi would be happy to have conversation around mnr and you had suggested i'm just trying to figure out in the next two weeks where should i put this in the priority no i think i actually talked to him today because i was on my way to meet tomi from kip and i was like can you give me examples of you know such and such scenario because i thought she was going to talk about rocky mountain prep which she needs to talk about at all ok i don't i don't know what's going on there hey sudha do you mind if we switch to the phone yeah let's do this yeah sure",

      "audioTranscript": "early data might not be straightforward right because like east hills spruce like they are only starting with kindergarten yeah or maybe the reality is by the time we even go to raise another fund we're going to need something we need something yeah in the academic piece yeah that's true yeah and my guess is like even in the next years bloomberg's diligence we might have to present something share something later half of next year yeah it's almost making me wonder yeah i don't want to get too cute about it but i'm like do we need to add a school or two that these higher performing dsst will probably help us with some some of this but that's not going to open till twenty eight twenty eight yeah that's true my head was going was like a peak to peak you know that's only adding like sixty kids but i'm like why not i mean i don't want to get too i don't know i don't know i just i feel like we're doing good work and i don't want it to like i want to be honest about the data and i also don't want i don't want to like torpedo everything because the first round of schools that we bet on are all like the improvement schools you know that's where i had a question of like were these really improvements schools or or because like if if i just we put in the like they aren't in the two thirds out performing you know we said this metric of two thirds of the schools we support are going to be in the top third yeah maybe that was also the wrong metric by the way i think that was my that is my main question so for example lydia like if we if we support lotus we are already right there like we like that's the thing right like because lotus school for excellence it is already in the top third of the similar schools but when you look at the absolute proficiency you'll be like oh what what the hell is going on here yeah so again like i i don't know like how this because right now these are the top third schools we went through this list to figure out who is growing and who wants to grow so either these are like dsst some rocky mountain prep schools or they are like these single site schools that are not growing so so that is that is where like i think i think if i look at it like most of it is like the new schools that we are supporting our hope is that it will basically start with this and some of the schools are here which we want to move here i think that's the bet yeah yeah but i agree like how do we show the right balance in terms of framing that is something that yeah we'll have to spend more time yeah i got yeah we got to think about a little bit i mean we did also give talent grants to a number of those schools okay all right which like from dollar value standpoint was way more than what we gave these schools in this first year so yeah okay this is the other like school by school which i kind of broke down ela and math for each of those schools and again not a very specific signs but looking at these three questions around the absolute or like proficiency in growth similar schools ranking and gaps like i kind of did the red yellow green for them based on which i think there are some bright spots here but otherwise it's which is reflected in the two by two also is is around the gaps so we can discuss each of the schools but this is just the next update from like a last discussion on how schools are performing individually yeah my slight amendment to this suit i'm sure might be for a k i mean their growth is really impressive and i still don't understand yeah that yeah so i wouldn't put them as red if they have my red was basically it was like down from last year and that's why it was red but yeah i i agree i think probably my to be determined the why behind this yeah okay introd for these calls are we pulling yeah so basically like whatever the dashboards that we have from cmas like the views that we are looking at wanted to make it transparent for them and share it so grounding in like how we look at the data especially similar school rank and like some of the growth data because again like everyone you talk to like it they will always start with like we are green on spf like that's the that's the single thing that i hear keying yesterday also i was talking to some new school leader and they were like yeah we are green for last three years four years and when i pulled their data on similar school rank they were in like bottom ten twelve fifteen percent so i was like okay so yeah that's the ideal area for each of those conversations wanted to share based on the data you shared like these are the views we have pulled and like let's anchor on our milestones were like to be in the top third like let's talk through like what would it take to i think it'd be helpful i guess we prepare for those conversations to just literally have what we're going to share with them for you and mita just align you know just make sure we're clear on who's communicating what message yeah yeah so i will have all those slides up i have already started putting together but next week there's only one call in rest of those are week after so for a k i've already put them together we can talk through that the other thing was like on the enrollment side i basically did like how they adjusted their budget but i think for me most most important was like what we had underwritten and how they're performing against that so for example yeah james irvin like by year two it should be two hundred fifty seats they are at one hundred thirty nine which is significantly below and then aak chose around three hundred ten and they are at two hundred thirty three again both of those have adjusted their budgets but am i bigger thing is like long term sustainability because these are in private facilities others have done pretty well with yeah others are all on track on enrollment that's exciting so for that conversation wanted to bring this up too of like the why and like paths to get back on track i'm most worried i would actually worried about both the schools in terms of like enrollment system or like financial sustainability long term they might have like some buffer to get through next couple of years but like it has to come back on track let's start with james irvin so rob is funny so he just responds to one part of the of the email and doesn't respond to the rest so he forwarded my email to someone in the team to upload the data or like share the data but didn't respond to the meeting invite so still i copied you on my response to that as well i'm also wondering i mean i could also sit down with him in the springs october twenty seventh if that's better although we probably should pull up get on the call so let me see this on monday yeah can we offer any more windows and i can come back on top of it this is just for rob yeah just for robin then what we discussed was that christy is going to connect with yeah christy is going to connect with carrie okay and are we looking for a thirty minute zoom call yeah so you said should i respond to that and offer more windows no i'm going to respond to elevate it and but i want to add in a couple windows next week yeah you can do it next week or even week after i have hold on your calendars yeah that's what i'm just going to add those is what i was saying so you said twelve fourteen or twelve sixteen okay twelve okay and then the other whole time it's the twenty second yeah yeah let me one to three pm the other whole time is yeah twenty yeah that twenty second block okay set okay i'm just gonna grab a little lunch while we're talking i might just yeah video for a second this is i think like a k is the next one this is we are connecting with nicole next week on sixteenth today i think here we probably might have to have like more direct conversation one was like yeah we we will share the academic analysis we'll talk through that but i think like here the challenge is more around like both enrollment and others so again like nicole has shared that like last year her capacity was the challenge but like my guess is there is more why beneath that so wanted to understand that better and then the other thing was like you and christy had discussed to visit sometime in november so just leave it like want to make sure we communicate that to have a follow up meeting with christy deep diving into their data yeah yeah i think sinatra might wondering is what are the benchmark what do we want to see like they are one where we probably want to stay a lot closer this year wouldn't we want to see by when on the annual front for next year to give us confidence and we should probably also signal that our grant for next fall or be at risk if we don't see significant improvement yeah so i think there are two thirty three and will be going after next so sorry can you say more on like the benchmark for enrollment it seems like their challenge this year is they just started focusing on it way too late yeah it's actually this time of year when you need to be doing your big effort on enrollment and so like we may want to track more interim data on there either us or are they working with vanessa like what are we basically saying like needs to be true is that they maybe find like the they need to hit a stronger number earlier yeah earlier than they did last year yeah so i guess like yeah so like i think the two matrix that they will be closely i mean they should be closely tracking which i know at least from my conversation with vanessa was like the number of new leads and then basically ak's role is to be to continue to follow up with them to convert but lydia i think on the enrollment side they'll continue to generate leads from now till may but like most of the conversions actually happen after may next year so i'm curious i don't know if you'll know we'll have like confirmed enrollments per se before april may next year that seems really late to me i think we can have like the benchmarks for like the number of confirmations by march by april and by may so that like we know how things are tracking there earlier than that i'd be really curious to understand i mean you know each community is a little different in terms of when parents are enrolling and everything school choice is happening in denver this fall like parents are making decisions now about where their kids are going to be at school next year i don't know exactly what it looks like in fort collins and who their competitors are but it might be helpful i'm almost wondering if we could get a sense of this from like jenny at access like what time of year they have parents commit and everything but may is way too late i would imagine it would be more like january february but i don't you know if the competing is private schools that's usually in the fall i don't know based on the last year cycle i think they were tracking more conversions like in in like the spring months not not this fall like denver might be different but i think that's what i'm saying didn't work it was too late okay that way yeah i can check with jenny in terms of like when is there majority of their new enrollments happen just what's the time of year your parents are making decisions know when did the other choice schools have big pushes on enrollment you know okay so we can we can again i can i can connect with vanessa before and then i can also check with jenny because i'm meeting her on fifteenth so i'll i'll know more about fort collins and like that dynamics there but we can bring this up in terms of like getting clarity much earlier like january february time frame to understand how enrollment is planning for the next year sirha the fort collins global district i just looked at their website it's does the school choice portal opens the first run is november third through december fifteenth the second round is january to may yeah and that is first choice like in a month but like aek is not part of that right they're not part of it but that's a really important timeline for what most parents in the district are anchoring on when they're choosing schools yeah stop sharing yeah so they basically said that enrollment for twenty six twenty seven school year begins in on november first for for ak but i think most of the conversions happen pretty late last year we can talk more about this with them but my sense is that the big part of that challenge is their timeline is way off then rest of the market for their big push and everything you know oh my god what happened website they got there's one thing they need to i'm not just on their website which is not working which section they have a thing that says our tuition can be found here but they mean that for their pre k program not their whole program but it's not clear like are they offering tours this fall like they don't have that on their website they should be offering weekly tours right now i don't know there just seems like there's like a lot of things they might need help with i don't know you know anyway i don't want to get too lagged down the reads on this but they need help i think they need help yeah so i think like the core question is because again in this part also like vanessa had suggested lot of website updates to this and like firmly experience standpoint also which again a kid in implement so i'm i'm trying to figure out like is this more of the execution issue or like is it like the support that vanessa is getting is not working here well let's just ask her when we talk next week yeah okay so two things one is like just understanding under the hood of like how or the why and how behind the enrollment and getting the clarity on like by when they will know how it's trending for the next year hopefully by next january we'll have more data from them and then the on the academic side lydia again this is their data terms of two by two but their growth is high so i was curious on like just the framing for this like should we leave it at like would like to understand more around this data i'd be curious for hypothesis on the disconnect between the two yeah and then i just want to introduce this i don't know how much time we've spent with her on this view you know so just want to like help her really internalize it in an ideal world this is where you know you'd be i don't know why sandra why are some of these ray and some so the color colored are all charter schools like the dark ones okay and then the dark blue are top third light like this blue is in middle and then gray are all bottom third okay is there a way to not have the charter filter on there because i think it i think it's simpler if it's just all schools and you see the top third do you know what i mean yeah i can i can i can remove that i actually did it yes if i change it no it will show all schools i think that'll just be easier to explain like digest for her okay okay so i would just say i think over time we want to see you definitely in the middle third and ideally in the top third what other support do you need and then also tee up this idea of you know coming to visit and yeah doing a deeper dive of the data yeah so let's just spend time on just this this two by two i mean because i had pulled together all data but it'll be too much to bring up and i don't know there are other main takeaways other than this slide yeah i think that's smart we can have chris to go into the details yeah and i can yeah we can share that as a follow up but like this one is something we can spend time on okay so enrollment and this slide i think this is one where overall performance is okay it's just going from good to great there two by two is here on the line and slightly above the line in ela you know yeah yeah i think just spending time on two by two i think enrollment wise they're fine yeah nothing wasn't student group gap like oh yeah that might be the other one we use with them it's just like this continues to be something we're monitoring and really want to see improve yeah i think that yeah that is the one it's much more it's significantly high yeah so i think i'll i'll pull this view as well for them it is twenty five percent gap here yeah same with crown point leader y ep linear heritage heights we don't have the call schedule but i think you and i had discussed like i will pull the views for them which can be helpful for their charter and then you said later in fall you might have conversation with natalia to same sharing these views so maybe we try to do it but soon onto the next few weeks before you go just the same thing you know we just again here's how we look at it here's what's important to us what would it take for you all to get to this top third yeah i think they have the best bet of getting there of anyone that's true in this group so i think we should have that conversation we can just do it over zoom okay so i'll reach out to her and schedule that time there okay i'm glad i have those blocks on your calendar but still holds are still there i love her time well i changed my you know the fact that i canceled my trip on the twenty eighth is going to be very helpful for everything yeah uprep we are visiting there it was just pre k and i think literacy is the big open question here again here like the tricky part is like should we just look at the commerce city data or the network because commercially data is we don't have much there we're just looking at conversity for you know like our accountability purposes yeah but from a from a how do we make sure they're operating in a strong way and have a good solid yellow program that's why we're visiting steel and looking at the network okay yeah so i don't think like i have like again i can just pull like up network views if you want to share the data so i think that will be helpful for the conversation yeah i think so too kelly we are we are connecting very limited data all over the place nothing concrete yet so connecting with her to one like understand how they are tracking the data because when i looked at their dash board the data that they have submitted is also like all over the place so we have dibels data but like other nwa map data is like very limited n size is eight and like hard to interpret anything can we see any difference between grain junction and aurora we don't even it's too small to even have any yeah pretty small i can check but steve if we can separate it out because the the challenge yeah i think we'll have i'll have to work with steve to do it more because i think they coded by by whatever each site is a different name and then when you break it down by that it becomes like even like n size becomes even more small so every percentage so because they don't tag it as aurora or grand valley it's just the site name so i might have to figure out with steve like is there a way to do that on the back end to just say aurora all the sites in aurora and all the sites in grand junction or one site in grand junction pull up the data does this have an n size on it anywhere like yeah yeah okay for each grade but it's across eighteen across all sites no yeah why are these numbers so low doesn't make sense to me which one any of them because their third grade is only in aurora there was no third grade book eighteen they only have eighteen kindergartners across both classes i guess that might be right jeez yeah that's the one wildflower this year so this is twenty eight this year so last year yeah i think should be fine so this is like their grade level enroll i would just really like to hear them actually like i don't think they actually believe in data or i don't think rachel believes in data i just want you to like ask them what are they learning from it what are they change like little interrogate a little bit almost you know yeah yeah okay still hold up to get them off to see libertas in memphis at some point and then lady hierarchies can you remind me what we discussed with laurel and laura on connecting with christy initial i was trying to recollect and i remember we told them that we'll make the connection was it more around the literacy program well i think we said we were going to check with christy on the leather there was anyone it was around the fluid sea question right i wrote it down hold on is there any targeted fluency support in phonics for kids that they actually enjoy that was the question okay so this is it i'll prepare materials for each of those conversations in the agenda thank you and then do a little bit more thinking and we can discuss more next week on rolling up this data for the board for the board yeah let's do know for the board we should have all the schools that are open and maybe like an on track to opening for the ones we've invested that are not don't have data yet you know just kind of how they're trending in these areas i don't know and i think i think a regular green plus like two bullets for each is fine okay two bullets per school or three bullets per school overall you know it doesn't need to be overly i don't think we need to be like overly sharing a bajillion things yeah yeah okay i'm envisioning like one page or one slide one slide for the portfolio yeah yeah okay sounds thanks for all the work on this too yeah no this was helpful as i was like pulling all this data i was like yeah this is like i think it'll be helpful to anchor or like ask the right questions now so that and then lydia

        "audioTranscript": "early data might not be straightforward right because like east hills spruce like they are only starting with kindergarten yeah or maybe the reality is by the time we even go to raise another fund we're going to need something we need something yeah in the academic piece yeah that's true yeah and my guess is like even in the next years bloomberg's diligence we might have to present something share something later half of next year yeah it's almost making me wonder yeah i don't want to get too cute about it but i'm like do we need to add a school or two that these higher performing dsst will probably help us with some some of this but that's not going to open till twenty eight twenty eight yeah that's true my head was going was like a peak to peak you know that's only adding like sixty kids but i'm like why not i mean i don't want to get too i don't know i don't know i just i feel like we're doing good work and i don't want it to like i want to be honest about the data and i also don't want i don't want to like torpedo everything because the first round of schools that we bet on are all like the improvement schools you know that's where i had a question of like were these really improvements schools or or because like if if i just we put in the like they aren't in the two thirds out performing you know we said this metric of two thirds of the schools we support are going to be in the top third yeah maybe that was also the wrong metric by the way i think that was my that is my main question so for example lydia like if we if we support lotus we are already right there like we like that's the thing right like because lotus school for excellence it is already in the top third of the similar schools but when you look at the absolute proficiency you'll be like oh what what the hell is going on here yeah so again like i i don't know like how this because right now these are the top third schools we went through this list to figure out who is growing and who wants to grow so either these are like dsst some rocky mountain prep schools or they are like these single site schools that are not growing so so that is that is where like i think i think if i look at it like most of it is like the new schools that we are supporting our hope is that it will basically start with this and some of the schools are here which we want to move here i think that's the bet yeah yeah but i agree like how do we show the right balance in terms of framing that is something that yeah we'll have to spend more time yeah i got yeah we got to think about a little bit i mean we did also give talent grants to a number of those schools okay all right which like from dollar value standpoint was way more than what we gave these schools in this first year so yeah okay this is the other like school by school which i kind of broke down ela and math for each of those schools and again not a very specific signs but looking at these three questions around the absolute or like proficiency in growth similar schools ranking and gaps like i kind of did the red yellow green for them based on which i think there are some bright spots here but otherwise it's which is reflected in the two by two also is is around the gaps so we can discuss each of the schools but this is just the next update from like a last discussion on how schools are performing individually yeah my slight amendment to this suit i'm sure might be for a k i mean their growth is really impressive and i still don't understand yeah that yeah so i wouldn't put them as red if they have my red was basically it was like down from last year and that's why it was red but yeah i i agree i think probably my to be determined the why behind this yeah okay introd for these calls are we pulling yeah so basically like whatever the dashboards that we have from cmas like the views that we are looking at wanted to make it transparent for them and share it so grounding in like how we look at the data especially similar school rank and like some of the growth data because again like everyone you talk to like it they will always start with like we are green on spf like that's the that's the single thing that i hear keying yesterday also i was talking to some new school leader and they were like yeah we are green for last three years four years and when i pulled their data on similar school rank they were in like bottom ten twelve fifteen percent so i was like okay so yeah that's the ideal area for each of those conversations wanted to share based on the data you shared like these are the views we have pulled and like let's anchor on our milestones were like to be in the top third like let's talk through like what would it take to i think it'd be helpful i guess we prepare for those conversations to just literally have what we're going to share with them for you and mita just align you know just make sure we're clear on who's communicating what message yeah yeah so i will have all those slides up i have already started putting together but next week there's only one call in rest of those are week after so for a k i've already put them together we can talk through that the other thing was like on the enrollment side i basically did like how they adjusted their budget but i think for me most most important was like what we had underwritten and how they're performing against that so for example yeah james irvin like by year two it should be two hundred fifty seats they are at one hundred thirty nine which is significantly below and then aak chose around three hundred ten and they are at two hundred thirty three again both of those have adjusted their budgets but am i bigger thing is like long term sustainability because these are in private facilities others have done pretty well with yeah others are all on track on enrollment that's exciting so for that conversation wanted to bring this up too of like the why and like paths to get back on track i'm most worried i would actually worried about both the schools in terms of like enrollment system or like financial sustainability long term they might have like some buffer to get through next couple of years but like it has to come back on track let's start with james irvin so rob is funny so he just responds to one part of the of the email and doesn't respond to the rest so he forwarded my email to someone in the team to upload the data or like share the data but didn't respond to the meeting invite so still i copied you on my response to that as well i'm also wondering i mean i could also sit down with him in the springs october twenty seventh if that's better although we probably should pull up get on the call so let me see this on monday yeah can we offer any more windows and i can come back on top of it this is just for rob yeah just for robin then what we discussed was that christy is going to connect with yeah christy is going to connect with carrie okay and are we looking for a thirty minute zoom call yeah so you said should i respond to that and offer more windows no i'm going to respond to elevate it and but i want to add in a couple windows next week yeah you can do it next week or even week after i have hold on your calendars yeah that's what i'm just going to add those is what i was saying so you said twelve fourteen or twelve sixteen okay twelve okay and then the other whole time it's the twenty second yeah yeah let me one to three pm the other whole time is yeah twenty yeah that twenty second block okay set okay i'm just gonna grab a little lunch while we're talking i might just yeah video for a second this is i think like a k is the next one this is we are connecting with nicole next week on sixteenth today i think here we probably might have to have like more direct conversation one was like yeah we we will share the academic analysis we'll talk through that but i think like here the challenge is more around like both enrollment and others so again like nicole has shared that like last year her capacity was the challenge but like my guess is there is more why beneath that so wanted to understand that better and then the other thing was like you and christy had discussed to visit sometime in november so just leave it like want to make sure we communicate that to have a follow up meeting with christy deep diving into their data yeah yeah i think sinatra might wondering is what are the benchmark what do we want to see like they are one where we probably want to stay a lot closer this year wouldn't we want to see by when on the annual front for next year to give us confidence and we should probably also signal that our grant for next fall or be at risk if we don't see significant improvement yeah so i think there are two thirty three and will be going after next so sorry can you say more on like the benchmark for enrollment it seems like their challenge this year is they just started focusing on it way too late yeah it's actually this time of year when you need to be doing your big effort on enrollment and so like we may want to track more interim data on there either us or are they working with vanessa like what are we basically saying like needs to be true is that they maybe find like the they need to hit a stronger number earlier yeah earlier than they did last year yeah so i guess like yeah so like i think the two matrix that they will be closely i mean they should be closely tracking which i know at least from my conversation with vanessa was like the number of new leads and then basically ak's role is to be to continue to follow up with them to convert but lydia i think on the enrollment side they'll continue to generate leads from now till may but like most of the conversions actually happen after may next year so i'm curious i don't know if you'll know we'll have like confirmed enrollments per se before april may next year that seems really late to me i think we can have like the benchmarks for like the number of confirmations by march by april and by may so that like we know how things are tracking there earlier than that i'd be really curious to understand i mean you know each community is a little different in terms of when parents are enrolling and everything school choice is happening in denver this fall like parents are making decisions now about where their kids are going to be at school next year i don't know exactly what it looks like in fort collins and who their competitors are but it might be helpful i'm almost wondering if we could get a sense of this from like jenny at access like what time of year they have parents commit and everything but may is way too late i would imagine it would be more like january february but i don't you know if the competing is private schools that's usually in the fall i don't know based on the last year cycle i think they were tracking more conversions like in in like the spring months not not this fall like denver might be different but i think that's what i'm saying didn't work it was too late okay that way yeah i can check with jenny in terms of like when is there majority of their new enrollments happen just what's the time of year your parents are making decisions know when did the other choice schools have big pushes on enrollment you know okay so we can we can again i can i can connect with vanessa before and then i can also check with jenny because i'm meeting her on fifteenth so i'll i'll know more about fort collins and like that dynamics there but we can bring this up in terms of like getting clarity much earlier like january february time frame to understand how enrollment is planning for the next year sirha the fort collins global district i just looked at their website it's does the school choice portal opens the first run is november third through december fifteenth the second round is january to may yeah and that is first choice like in a month but like aek is not part of that right they're not part of it but that's a really important timeline for what most parents in the district are anchoring on when they're choosing schools yeah stop sharing yeah so they basically said that enrollment for twenty six twenty seven school year begins in on november first for for ak but i think most of the conversions happen pretty late last year we can talk more about this with them but my sense is that the big part of that challenge is their timeline is way off then rest of the market for their big push and everything you know oh my god what happened website they got there's one thing they need to i'm not just on their website which is not working which section they have a thing that says our tuition can be found here but they mean that for their pre k program not their whole program but it's not clear like are they offering tours this fall like they don't have that on their website they should be offering weekly tours right now i don't know there just seems like there's like a lot of things they might need help with i don't know you know anyway i don't want to get too lagged down the reads on this but they need help i think they need help yeah so i think like the core question is because again in this part also like vanessa had suggested lot of website updates to this and like firmly experience standpoint also which again a kid in implement so i'm i'm trying to figure out like is this more of the execution issue or like is it like the support that vanessa is getting is not working here well let's just ask her when we talk next week yeah okay so two things one is like just understanding under the hood of like how or the why and how behind the enrollment and getting the clarity on like by when they will know how it's trending for the next year hopefully by next january we'll have more data from them and then the on the academic side lydia again this is their data terms of two by two but their growth is high so i was curious on like just the framing for this like should we leave it at like would like to understand more around this data i'd be curious for hypothesis on the disconnect between the two yeah and then i just want to introduce this i don't know how much time we've spent with her on this view you know so just want to like help her really internalize it in an ideal world this is where you know you'd be i don't know why sandra why are some of these ray and some so the color colored are all charter schools like the dark ones okay and then the dark blue are top third light like this blue is in middle and then gray are all bottom third okay is there a way to not have the charter filter on there because i think it i think it's simpler if it's just all schools and you see the top third do you know what i mean yeah i can i can i can remove that i actually did it yes if i change it no it will show all schools i think that'll just be easier to explain like digest for her okay okay so i would just say i think over time we want to see you definitely in the middle third and ideally in the top third what other support do you need and then also tee up this idea of you know coming to visit and yeah doing a deeper dive of the data yeah so let's just spend time on just this this two by two i mean because i had pulled together all data but it'll be too much to bring up and i don't know there are other main takeaways other than this slide yeah i think that's smart we can have chris to go into the details yeah and i can yeah we can share that as a follow up but like this one is something we can spend time on okay so enrollment and this slide i think this is one where overall performance is okay it's just going from good to great there two by two is here on the line and slightly above the line in ela you know yeah yeah i think just spending time on two by two i think enrollment wise they're fine yeah nothing wasn't student group gap like oh yeah that might be the other one we use with them it's just like this continues to be something we're monitoring and really want to see improve yeah i think that yeah that is the one it's much more it's significantly high yeah so i think i'll i'll pull this view as well for them it is twenty five percent gap here yeah same with crown point leader y ep linear heritage heights we don't have the call schedule but i think you and i had discussed like i will pull the views for them which can be helpful for their charter and then you said later in fall you might have conversation with natalia to same sharing these views so maybe we try to do it but soon onto the next few weeks before you go just the same thing you know we just again here's how we look at it here's what's important to us what would it take for you all to get to this top third yeah i think they have the best bet of getting there of anyone that's true in this group so i think we should have that conversation we can just do it over zoom okay so i'll reach out to her and schedule that time there okay i'm glad i have those blocks on your calendar but still holds are still there i love her time well i changed my you know the fact that i canceled my trip on the twenty eighth is going to be very helpful for everything yeah uprep we are visiting there it was just pre k and i think literacy is the big open question here again here like the tricky part is like should we just look at the commerce city data or the network because commercially data is we don't have much there we're just looking at conversity for you know like our accountability purposes yeah but from a from a how do we make sure they're operating in a strong way and have a good solid yellow program that's why we're visiting steel and looking at the network okay yeah so i don't think like i have like again i can just pull like up network views if you want to share the data so i think that will be helpful for the conversation yeah i think so too kelly we are we are connecting very limited data all over the place nothing concrete yet so connecting with her to one like understand how they are tracking the data because when i looked at their dash board the data that they have submitted is also like all over the place so we have dibels data but like other nwa map data is like very limited n size is eight and like hard to interpret anything can we see any difference between grain junction and aurora we don't even it's too small to even have any yeah pretty small i can check but steve if we can separate it out because the the challenge yeah i think we'll have i'll have to work with steve to do it more because i think they coded by by whatever each site is a different name and then when you break it down by that it becomes like even like n size becomes even more small so every percentage so because they don't tag it as aurora or grand valley it's just the site name so i might have to figure out with steve like is there a way to do that on the back end to just say aurora all the sites in aurora and all the sites in grand junction or one site in grand junction pull up the data does this have an n size on it anywhere like yeah yeah okay for each grade but it's across eighteen across all sites no yeah why are these numbers so low doesn't make sense to me which one any of them because their third grade is only in aurora there was no third grade book eighteen they only have eighteen kindergartners across both classes i guess that might be right jeez yeah that's the one wildflower this year so this is twenty eight this year so last year yeah i think should be fine so this is like their grade level enroll i would just really like to hear them actually like i don't think they actually believe in data or i don't think rachel believes in data i just want you to like ask them what are they learning from it what are they change like little interrogate a little bit almost you know yeah yeah okay still hold up to get them off to see libertas in memphis at some point and then lady hierarchies can you remind me what we discussed with laurel and laura on connecting with christy initial i was trying to recollect and i remember we told them that we'll make the connection was it more around the literacy program well i think we said we were going to check with christy on the leather there was anyone it was around the fluid sea question right i wrote it down hold on is there any targeted fluency support in phonics for kids that they actually enjoy that was the question okay so this is it i'll prepare materials for each of those conversations in the agenda thank you and then do a little bit more thinking and we can discuss more next week on rolling up this data for the board for the board yeah let's do know for the board we should have all the schools that are open and maybe like an on track to opening for the ones we've invested that are not don't have data yet you know just kind of how they're trending in these areas i don't know and i think i think a regular green plus like two bullets for each is fine okay two bullets per school or three bullets per school overall you know it doesn't need to be overly i don't think we need to be like overly sharing a bajillion things yeah yeah okay i'm envisioning like one page or one slide one slide for the portfolio yeah yeah okay sounds thanks for all the work on this too yeah no this was helpful as i was like pulling all this data i was like yeah this is like i think it'll be helpful to anchor or like ask the right questions now so that and then lydia we have before i leave i think we have the one hour with greg to follow up on like what we had conversation around our portfolio management strategy or philosophy so we have a follow up on that in the next steps i think he was more of like hey this is the project plan and we discussed about interviewing school leaders i was like okay probably like after this round of data collection i think we should reflect on some of the questions we discussed and how we want to approach yeah yeah so we have that time too before i leave there were other quick things norwood meeting rich said he can join so i'll respond to eric and we'll share the zoom invite for everyone then did you see email from sarah about ste i just saw it yeah yeah so aaron emailed me this morning saying that hey do you have other denver schools you're working with for this the two potentials we two potential we had discussed were odyssey you had said they should open the middle school there and then the other one was magic school case they have to go private facility is it ok if i schedule like a follow up call with him would you like to join yeah i thought you already had reached out yeah but he specifically reached out about denver i reached out indian respond but probably this news kind of made him ok so i'll do that once you go to school in that space i think suhachu we should do know do you remember how much their rent is because they'll be a gap year if it's magic school yeah there will be a gap year i need to double check on the rent i can double check i have the numbers i worked with their board regular to pull that number i think there were two parts to it one was like their actual school rent was pretty low but this common area rent or cam that they were paying because it was for the whole property which made it slightly high so we can negotiate like probably just holding the facility by paying the school rent not the common area rent yeah that could be one thing we can discuss but i'll pull the numbers like what exactly how much it was exactly ok this one we discussed dan said that yahi would be happy to have conversation around mnr and you had suggested i'm just trying to figure out in the next two weeks where should i put this in the priority no i think i actually talked to him today because i was on my way to meet tomi from kip and i was like can you give me examples of you know such and such scenario because i thought she was going to talk about rocky mountain prep which she needs to talk about at all ok i don't i don't know what's going on there hey sudha do you mind if we switch to the phone yeah let's do this yeah sure",

          "content": "hey zach how are you good after noon pretty good how are you guys wearing fair play this week yes we went there tuesday to hierarchies how about how's that going pretty good like again had more interest than they had anticipated initially in enrollment so from enrollment standpoint it was pretty good the csi approval that they got was like starting with twenty students maximum go up to thirty six they started with fifty one kids so there's like one district so the interesting thing about park county is like there's one district school but the district pans the driving distance of one and a half hour so there are families that are either homeschooling not going not sending kids to school so those are the families that kind of connect with with hierarchies they were like at least like fifteen to twenty percent of the students that were otherwise homeschooling that have come back into yeah yeah that's great so yeah it was good and then yeah i think this year they because of csp they've also like made sure they are to have a strong launch their staffing more than they initially had in the budget so all those things are helping them in terms of getting the students the only thing is like all the homeschooling kids are coming in far behind especially on the reading fluency and literacy and doing k through eight together has its own challenges so yeah yeah i was just randomly an old friend of mine is thinking about movements to salida and c school back then i was telling her about hierarchies because the charter the full charter approval and some of these small towns like we're kind of going to experience this with rebecca and grand junction can be tough because even if you're coming with one hundred or two hundred kids that's such a big percentage of the district but i was telling her that there's probably some number of like a macro micro school that if you get to it's big enough that you can afford to do it and it's not scary enough for the district that you can maybe get approval yeah the interesting thing and again i don't know the salida we can do more research into that but when we were studying the park county part so like park county in of itself doesn't have lot of like enrollment potential there's one district school but then submit county next to it in the north and then two other counties in the south they have like more than seven eight thousand students so so that is where like hierarchies did the smart thing by getting a charter approved for two hundred plus students i think two hundred fifteen students or something from csi so now like the can they afford transportation to be able to get all those kids no so so they so they basically are going to do like four different micro sites at four different location because again driving distance is the big factor for families so that's how they're thinking about so two other microsite more closer to summit counties how they're thinking okay so they'll have four micro micro sites yeah so four sites with like fifty students fourteen to fifty students so that they can get to like two hundred across the chart yeah yeah cool zach after our last conversation i kind of like ran some numbers did some math and then as we had discussed like put together like the the users and then for this call wanted to like brainstorm the sources side with you and then also like get your thoughts on like framing for norwood framing for like rest of the funders of like how to get this done so we can spend little sometime on that as well let me show so just a quick high level i think so i met with ted just to kind of get his appetite because obviously we need a leader we're going to move faster and then i think what we both talked about what's clear is that it's going to have to be the perch around site it can't be not the nord yeah there's nothing out there so he drove around on we had our check in on tuesday and i have been telling him freestyle just because i you know it's still early enough that it's all it kind of all feels conceptual and then i think after our call last friday which is great obviously like what am i doing going here we can we can't plan on a brand new ten million dollar school or ten dollar school being open in eighteen months on the development that has no roads right there are no roads there right now that's probably not going to you know fly so he drove up to percheron and they're much more it's still very new but there's homes actually there there's roads there the development i think norwood has gotten all of the development plan approved so the plan i think is like set and now they're building it and i just think for this first potential pilot site that's what i'm thinking so i reached out to eric schofield just to say hey can we get together because eric had reached out when you guys were down ironically to be like hey how about a hillsdale school right and i was like hey how about something else like right so i'm meeting with him on tuesday just to kind of get a sense to tell him just to say like this is all really big but can you work with chris to kind of give us a sense of is this at all possible that you're ready to go in mainland by the summer and the latest case right to where we can actually start building something in the next year or two just to know with them that we're not off by like one to three years of their development cycle so if i'm going to start having that conversation with eric at like a lower level and then i know you and lydia are going to be meeting with chris at some point this month yeah but my hope is this month that we can first confirm from that m are they even within like a standard deviation of being ready to do something of this magnitude to call a shot to donate land to do a charter to pick a fellow like that we have now or are we still kind of future casting and we've got to slow this all down and right away ted and i right we were like if nora doesn't do this she got you ted can't go to d forty nine it's just not possible because there's no there's no buildings up there and so we could get him a charter but like the only deal that he could get is a high mark deal and i don't think anybody wants that and so i think that that's where i just realized after last week from our position right like we like if norwood does something our fellow named ted knight can do something and d forty nine and he's been building towards that obviously he's you know he's written the first you know one hundred of the one hundred twenty five page application he's talked to the superintendent and then everybody but i think after our conversation last friday and when i was talking to him and we both were like you know it's not going to do that or you're not interested right because you look at and you're like this is a bad capital stack right then we've got immediately find him a different place to go because there's no facility option in d forty nine that works with that many kids with that like sixty percent not free and reduced lunch population it's just not built out and so i think that that's what we're trying to figure out in the next couple months is like is this norwood csf thing a real possibility and if not we got to pivot like really quick with him to go somewhere else yeah so no that's that's something again when i was running this i had the same conclusion so i think we are pretty aligned there the second just the clarifying question so when you say novard like if this is a possibility and if we can do something is it about the site that you had shown me or is it about the other side that already has the perch around site so does norwood have presence there and like can they donate land there so that's their other development it's just like it's one mile north okay so that also is is norwood so it will be the similar blueprint like either here or not okay it's in normal development that's actually being that actually has homes in it right okay i think you might only have fifty or one hundred homes right but it's it's approved they're building it it's come and i think when the marzano school got approved to got you i think they penciled in that they were going to buy that school site from norwood and you should i if you don't have it but percheron's p e r c h e r o n if you don't have that somewhere in email i can send you the developer i have the blank page development plan it it looks essentially like freestyle it's just a mile north and it's probably a year to three years ahead of the freestyle development got it and it has a designated like roughly twenty acre site that's going to be for school and i my gut would be is if we don't step in one of two things is going to happen either marzano or an existing charter school is going to buy it from them or eric and chris are going to run out and find a hill scale classical school and try to recruit them to come to that site that's what i would guess like if you look at me like look this all sounded great but this is just this is nuts there's no way of doing this money we looked at is that this is not we don't want to be there i just think one of the approved charters of the forty nine will buy it or eric and chris will go out and use it as bait to recruit bill scale classical network to come and then in that case i mean i do think there's a domino chain that if they were to do that and i think it's just like a possibility that then they would just be like yeah let's just copy paste this yeah yeah it's just they're all still classical it's a whole network comes yeah and for the next twenty years every time they open up development they bring hillsdale school to it yeah zach a question on so i think when we were in idaho mark had shared that one of the reasons why these new developments are partnering with charter schools versus district is that like district is moving slow it has been difficult to pass the bond and charters are getting at least some portion of their own capital and like some donation from the developer is at least getting them school which can help them sell homes i'm just curious like how's that how's that dynamics in d forty nine is there a bond yeah i mean that's where i just really appreciated yeah i don't know trip i thought it was going to be good but i think it's exact i mean it's not perfect overlay but it's almost the same this issue like d forty nine is not good like when we talk to the lance and i talk to the superintendent and we were just like hey are you thinking about a bond or a bill yeah and they're like no that's never going to happen we tried a twenty three and we got crushed and we were like well twenty three was not a good time to go and they were just like i don't know so they don't have enough money to match the growth of nullwood so they're going to be behind it but then i think without you guys at the table showing norwood how to do this in a different way norwood would either just i mean honestly they would just sell the land to marzano and be like they have to deliver however they're doing it with highmark right and they would probably have somehow that if you don't deliver a school i don't know they can rebuy it going i don't know how developers do that but nobody norwood doesn't have the money to build the schools and the district doesn't have the money to build those goals and i think that that's certainly the case i mean i think that miners you being at the table or us being at the table nor would just have sold these pieces to these classical schools they would have bootstrapped it but that bootstrap would have come at the cost of basically any low income kid amenities that you need to transportation outreach whatever and it would just be is probably rich as possible to match the brand new development that that's what i would guess because i think that that's what we saw with marzano's charter presentation is i'm guessing kymark can step in and tell everybody it's super doable and then the weight of that all just goes to the marzano folks and if they deliver they deliver it if not marziana owns the land and sells it to somebody else yeah okay i'm starting with the thesis that percheron site has development requires a school either it can be a marzano school or xyz classical school or hillsdale yeah or but there is a need and like we want to compete to make sure or we want to present a plan which is in partnership with norwood like is more doable than other options so that we can have the high chance yeah okay yeah and there's not actually what's the nice thing about the percheron side is when you go like one mile i don't know it's like maybe it's three miles it's not that far but once you go like one standard deviation north there's no charter school out there down by freestyle there's a school called rocky mountain classical that's already full on the west side of it there's so much growth coming that there could easily be another one down there but the nice thing about percheron is the closest one is being in academy and that was built for the danny lewis development and that's completely full so whoever gets to percheron and i think this is probably why marzano was so bullish or high mark was bullish with them as whoever gets the percheron first will have kids yeah would be my guest so last question on this like do we know where is marzano on all this right now like are they moving quickly we talked to them i mean i think the good thing is we got to we got to norwood soon enough that they have not they've not offered made committed to them yet yeah and then eric's email last week made it sound like an i'll confirm this on tuesday just some very basic things but it made it sound like they're they would even be more interested in just finding like a hillsdale school than just selling to marzano i picked up a vibe that they didn't love the marzano approach for whatever reason i don't know if it's because they want something so much more conservative without seeing a lot of things or not but yeah so those are the kind of three players i think that that's enough like for the thesis to kind of work out the hypothesis right that yeah if we move quickly we might be able to yeah we still have a chance okay okay this is super helpful context i think my question on enrollment i mean we'll have to dig more deep with brian on this but at least like knowing that it's not the empty side like gives me more more comfort and then the second question i had in my need to validate list was around the district bond which also you answered so and what i would say is bryce what is i think important that you can't write it into the model right because it's not you can't bank on it but i think there's an assumption that i have which is to make all of this just way less stressful for everybody right is if the ideal case would be is if we could do the pilot with ted affair and try to convince chris that like if we do this and they worked with you to create a more complex capital stack we shouldn't take a couple bites at the apple with that bond campaign and if it's not twenty six we should do it in twenty eight with the presidential it would be so ridiculous for that district to not go in twenty eight unless the economy is in like a depression and i think that that's where if you can somehow do it without the bond but have something that if the bond hits everybody gets made whole i don't know how you guys do that or how the complexity of that all shakes out but that's what i think everybody should do because that could be a huge win for csf norwood and the district and obviously the school because the school is going to need more like they're going to need at least two of these twenty twenty five million dollar buildings to be able to fit well three yeah ok so the bond part anyway for the phase one i had not included in any scenario and then for phase two it was one of the options that i had but we can we can talk through that as we get into this let me can you give me access to ok so zach i started with one like long term affordability because if it doesn't work in the long term like it will be i mean we can put lot of effort fixing it in the short term but then it will get stuck at some point so i started with that to say that ok across the two phases to serve twelve hundred students what would be the maximum cost that school can afford based on average costing and then what are the levels that we then need to pull to get it to schools affordability range either on the financing side or on the partnership side or other things but like at least this helped me lay out of like what is the need or like what is the gap that we need to figure out with different levers again fourteen thousand is not a d forty nine today revenue it is lower than that but again looking at like twenty thirty and beyond when it will be at full scale so fields conservative but still so this basically looking at that if school spends twelve percent of the revenue on facilities dead service the total cost project cost that they can afford like total debt is around twenty six million but around total project cost taking out all the financing other expenses is around twenty five million dollars is is what school can afford on its own now this was just again the starting point so like let's say if school goes out to finance this debt they can get twenty five million now this was very top down of like ok school spends twelve percent this is what they can do now then i did the bottoms up calculation i took out like all the knowledge i had about gem prep elevate all the other idaho schools to look at like what is their kind of square foot for like total number of students and like did all the math and understanding there i think for them it is between seventy to eighty five square foot per student is the building that they develop elevate is higher elevate is around one hundred ten because they have this technical building backside so they are around one hundred one hundred twenty but gem was more around eighty seventy to eighty five kind of use that as the base here for us for ted again we can change these numbers debate that but for the purpose of this exercise i think it was around sixty thousand square foot in phase one and then around forty forty five thousand dollars square foot in the phase two development was seven hundred and five hundred students again this is for discussion so we can change these numbers as we talk but this was my base case which i had developed so again this was the hard and soft cost not the other contingency and like other things but like this is what i have looked at again idaho projects are below that i think elevate was around two hundred eighty gm was around two hundred ninety so those were the things that we had but this is something that i need to validate and like we need to do more work on but based on something like this yeah i was going to say the good test case and that i've been thinking about as atlas just built their middle school the best grant right and that middle school project was somewhere around forty forty five thousand square feet yeah and that cost twenty five million dollars so i think and they already owned the land pretty frugal i mean you've now brittany right so i've just been using my head that you're probably going to get lucky in colorado springs to be at five hundred dollars a square foot in construction after you factor in the land costs factoring the land cost ok the only thing which happens with best grant like if you have received the best grant and you are getting the reimbursement i think and this was the thing that i faced in california a lot was like you have to go through if you're getting a federal or like a best kind of grant you have to go through like prevailing wage which increases the project budget by almost thirty percent it was around thirty five percent in california so that was another thing which we have to kind of figure out of like i mean thirty percent is a big number on five hundred like it will be around one hundred fifty dollars so i think that is like if we are not relying on a best kind of grand and if we can go directly that is where we can save on overall cost so instead of like twenty five million and i think the only thing that we talked about this last time is like and i fully agree with that could be twenty thirty percent just you have to do it because of how you have to do it invest yeah there's a norm quality preference taste tax but then also balance that out you could ignore what lights nice stuff and like that will also you just have that in the back of your mind that like you know norwood will want my assumption is normal to want these things to look at least ten percent nicer than what you know the charter would just be like we're totally fine it's a box it passes it has classrooms and passes like you know right inspections but this one i'm pretty sure test that as you talk with them about just there because chris is doing a lot with the palmer project right now sudan he took a whole like team he paid for like thirty people from colorado springs to go out to visit like historical beautiful buildings and on the east coast last year ahead of the palmer thing and like he's a part of that in that high school they have slated for two hundred million dollars and so it's not he's not going to want that on a charter but you'll just you'll want to feel that out i don't know but you'll want to feel that out because they're not always costco conservative type developer that's like you know very efficient they are very efficient but sometimes they like nice things yeah no which is which again depending on how big the hole is like we'll have to manage their expectation as well so that's why like this exercise was like okay if you want to do your quality like put it like make it closer to seven hundred and let's see what the hole is and then and then like if you want to save like this is what we typically look at so holes are going to be big i mean i like this because i'm like basically this even if it's this right they're going to be in the ballpark of forty to fifty million dollars right like even if like copy those and then you know i know you didn't get to it yet but like then it's going to be at least twice the the first math shows you they can afford at twenty five million right so so then then like the phase two i basically increased the price because it always does so so this was the phase two so now again we need to pressure test this assumption there is a trade off here clear trade off here around quality amenities all the things that we want to figure out but let's start with this number and we can keep playing with this number to come back to what we want so looking at that i kind of built the sources and users here for phase one and phase two so phase one again this is more of the predef cost of like initially working getting the site all those things and then this was just the land cost and other things that i have just named again these are the numbers to be tested but this number is basically donations of whatever price this gets to it will get adjusted here but then this was the construction cost and then some financing costs so it was around twenty six million dollars for phase one and then for the phase two like you in three years if you do that like the total cost is somewhere around forty million dollars is what what we have right now now again it's showing forty three million dollars because it it doesn't it includes the land and everything so that will be donated but let's say i think five million was the total indonesia okay so this was the affordability and this is where the project cost is landing across two faces i think the whole right now is around seventeen million dollars right so let's say five million is is donated there is still like a twelve million dollar gap that we need to figure out if if this works so so now then i again and then what are the levers that we have like there is some financing levers that we can pull but i think based on what i understand i think either either the fundraising bond or school increasing the spend on facilities are the three biggest drivers here financing might solve for like the short term but not for the long term for now so i think those were the three three levers that we had so the first lever which is more on ted's control is can they increase the spend instead of twelve percent to let's say fourteen on facilities for for comparison like idaho spends around fifteen sixteen to seventeen percent is what this kind because their ppr is also like much lower around nine thousand five hundred dollars is their property you've been selling fellows to do twenty just because we we can't fix twenty is everything zach like it will also might include the operating regular operating cost which is around four to five percent so if i just do the debt service part of it should be fourteen to fifteen percent so if we increase that let's say fifteen percent is what we do that so it it brings it reduces the need by around six million dollars overall so the the whole right now is around six point five million dollars you're right this is the i mean you this is the entire colorado spring story of charter schools in a nutshell right which is this is why we've never had any good equitable schools and we haven't even had any yeah if if like the school is spending fifty to fifteen percent of the revenue like it's it's coming at a cost of your program end of the day so what we don't exist no i'm saying they don't oh they don't exist yeah yeah yeah this is why none of we have no there's only one atlas in the whole city is because we didn't do this we went out and raised a bunch of money and we took out a tremendous amount of debt and then we passed the mill in a bond and then that's why now atlas exists and then the vanguard tca all the classical schools they started in the worst ugliest buildings where they like leased trailers and like thirty years later they finally you know had a modest building and so i think that that's that because in a nutshell in colorado springs you can't you know no schools ever raised five million dollars in plants b not one and no schools ever raised twelve million dollars in flint yeah so again like that is something that we are trying to fix but again there's no like one source that will fill everything so i'm i was just trying to see like okay and again if the bond or mill comes like lot of this will get solved like if if the school gets ten million even ten million dollars allocation from the bond like it significantly solves the need but i was like okay in the other scenario where like the bond is not the plug what do we do here so so that was that is what was trying to solve and i think that that right like i think that's what i would say right is like and and that assumes that you can really hold the three to four hundred a square foot what i don't know right which you'll have to tell me because you're also used to working in either richer markets or bigger state markets that have like bigger state funding per school maybe for grants foundations that are jcaf or growth funds or whatever so like that's the that's the thing zach like so jcaf didn't solve for the affordability for any of these schools like they only did the short term like whatever they did with building hope was only solving for the short term affordability problem not the long term affordability problem they didn't put they didn't put any equity in the building for any of the schools what is the way that idaho is solving for it so idaho basically is like their total project cost is around fifteen sixteen million dollars for their six hundred five to six hundred student schools right and and how they are doing it is basically yeah so that is the another level that i wanted to talk about which can solve is on the financing side is this right right now assuming like what's the current market rate for a typical cdfi loan now if the school gets eligible for moral obligation if there is some capital stack where we can leverage norwood's balance sheet or some kind of guarantee this is another level like instead of again one of the schools here just three months back got a loan for five point one percent so so if you do that what is that yeah so if i if i reduce it to let's say five percent and maturity on thirty five years because this is typically like what you can get if you have moral obligation you are in surplus here like so this if you go to fifteen percent and you get five nine bucks yeah if you go to fifteen percent yeah how did you get that how do you get that number this this number is basically yeah so this again schools are still getting this number for their long term financing so it's not completely like a concept that i'm talking about crown point academy just got five point one percent on their long term issue thirty five years because they had like they had an operating history and and certain financial position they applied for credit rating and they got the moral obligation state credit enhancement which basically reduced eric duran from from am i blanking short on the name we don't want to work with them but da davidson da davidson so he told me that he got a deal for one of the big charter school more classical kind at four point seven five percent so again these are not the concept numbers like we can get there and and kind of make it to some affordability this is another level that we can we need to figure out like we want to make sure that ted is hitting those financial targets to in five years to be able to qualify for this and then does the one that we went through that was idaho classical when they because they they needed that that phase two construction to start almost like immediately right catch up to their like like how how are how are they solving that where it's so again they're going for a short term financing now and like that is something that we will be discussing with norwood so short term financing how it works in idaho is that they get sixty five percent of the total cost as loan from the bank banks bank loans there are somewhere around five to five point five percent right now in in idaho same as here and then like basically over last five to seven years jcaf bloom and all the charter schools have made an effort and have created a revolving loan fund with idaho state so they provide two and a half million dollars at zero percent interest rate ecosystem that takes time to build with all these tools right that you help people set up i think one of the things just for today is you know i i understand no so again like again all those revolving loan funds equivalent of that and other things we can we can figure out and we can get to make it work in the short term i i'm not too worried about i think when you combine like right the norwood piece your guys's piece the the fast construction timeline right because maybe if all like if you and lydia and norwood and his head and us and lance sit down with peter at b forty ninth maybe there's some world where they allow us to get approved and you know april instead of june but i think for today i just wanted to get at a high level do you think it's possible to do this complex of a deal not not ever i think it's possible for sure ever but like where like kids would actually be walking into a new building in twenty months yeah none of this is yeah so i think i think it is possible the only three big variables that i wanted to get an understanding from you which we talked about was not from you like we have to do little more work to to for me to firmly give you that answer is the the construction cost like what i've assumed like if it is like two and a half times or two times twice of this i don't think this will work so so getting clarity on like hey am i working with the right numbers is forty million dollar building is what we are talking about for the school or are we talking about eighty billion dollar today so so that what would you make for three hundred fifty and the four hundred so i would say in in aurora the project that dsst or ast aurora science and technology is working on the total project cost there for eleven hundred students is fifty five million dollars okay so but again it's a it's a district building and they are going through they're building it to the standards of a new builder now it's a new build fresh like completely new build in a new upcoming development there yeah aurora highline so somewhere in the ballpark forty to fifty million but but their square footage would at least be one hundred twenty square foot per student yeah because it's it's it's a district like district is building that and owning is this a fair way to say this because i think there's a simple thing that i want to say to eric next week and also ted but if norwood were to donate the land and basically a million dollars worth of pre development services to be all in and let's say five million csf and legacy could match that five million from somebody else or another five million of grants and if we did that there's a project here and if we did that we could even try to get some of that money back in some complex way down the road if there's a bond pass is that a fair sentence yeah this is the the plug that five million dollars we have to fill if considering school is yeah and if we don't get a bond if we got a bond i would be hoping we get a lot more than six million dollars but if we don't get a bond that number we have to raise in blank yeah that's true yeah that's the to have any chance of making this even close to possible that sounds that's about right or does that is that include also the five percent is that five point eight yeah no five dollars you wrote into the first tab sorry so can you repeat that if you go back to that other tab where you put in an extra five million dollars of philanthropy in phase two yeah the affordability tab where you with that five million dollars right there this is basically the the land the land and norwood norwood basically land and and predef whatever they are going to put in this okay so that that assumes that we need that and then if we got a bond or well what happens if you if that number so if you assume norma gives the land and the pre development work at five and then you raise another five million dollars just so then school so then school will will have to will not have to spend fourteen percent of their revenue on facility only twelve you don't need five million from norwood five million from grant and five billion dollars from bonds you just need a total of about eight to ten million yeah this this is my gap that i'm solving for okay all right so total gap that i'm solving for so like the three livers that i was trying to pull is like how much norwood can give how much school can increase the annual spend so that they can raise more debt or bond was it my third big driver i think the fourth other driver is just the capital stack innovation which increase decreases the interest rate and brings this number down to let's say seven eight million dollars versus eleven yeah so those are the four those are the four things that we need to figure out yeah roughly it's a roughly fifty million dollars project that if we get five from norwood and five from somewhere else and do innovative things we have a chance of doing this no so the total project cost is around forty three to forty five million dollars let's let's anchor on forty five million dollars and this forty and school can basically afford around twenty five million dollars sorry you already adjusted the interest rate up top yeah that's with the five percent yeah so overall like this is the gap that exists now this can be solved like we'll have to pull all the other levers that we have is let me actually change this to let's say bond other philanthropy yeah school increase cool i don't see a world if we can't get a waste of five norwood's not going to put in five million if we can't match it with five million of something so i think that's where that has to be five because they won't do it if no one's going to match it yeah and then school increasing either school increases something or we decrease the interest rate here yeah you make that two percent what is what do we get to right off the bat so where are we yeah so we're in the ballpark and then the better rate would not get yeah and the better rate will knock it down further so yeah if we okay that's helpful because then i'm just going to kind of say like it's yeah we need five but if norwood what happens to donchu if norwood's able to get a higher appraisal of the land does that help if the land is artificially appraised higher does that help much or not really not really it's just that yeah we can we can probably say a few basis points here because the equity contribution is more yeah not significant yeah yeah okay because then then that is yeah yeah that is because right now what what i'm assuming here is like everything that is donated so whatever is the increase there is basically cancelling of indonesia so you don't have any cash from norwood in this model right this one donated services yeah this one no no other cash yeah but that five million is in cash right no this basically is total of this will just cut this off and i don't know if they do that or have the crap but if they did all the pre development and site work and donated the land and never gave you a dollar of cash yeah this is this is what this is what it assumes there's no cash on top of what these three things got it okay when you you've done a ton of these what how do you score how possible this is to all pull off in twenty months the financing side of this can be pulled i think like the biggest again let me go back to this one this is the biggest one which i'm not sure of oh sorry yeah this one yeah and that we need to like norwood i don't we'll find out you guys don't i think so this basically means the land donation so this is not additional but they have to do it or there's no project yeah yeah that that that is that is a given like yeah that has to be done otherwise there's no cons norwood land yeah okay so that was an assumption that has to get checked yeah yeah and and this is basically in schools control of how they come out sudashir how much time do you do what we have to find the second five million like we have to know norwood's five million soon now no we no we can we can go ahead with the first we can potentially go ahead with our phase one the phase one if if if we have all this in place i think the biggest challenge would be to make the short term affordability work and that is where our our grant funding and csp will basically solve for it yeah yeah okay and then would you have a year two years three years so again like that is that is that is a piece which i wanted to like again that would be a ted question right now my thinking this was something which i had in like if you are doing like a seven hundred student phase one and five hundred student phase two this is this is what i had in idaho basically built their buildings so they could have the full k eight phase one covered the full case so so jim actually tried both options they did the full build in one go they tried breaking it down i think for them like because they start with like k through two and five six or like six seven great and then build it out for them like space was space planning didn't work out well so they go for the whole thing together what would you recommend like if ted could film way more kids sooner should he do that or should he slow it down so you have time to raise the capital stack for phase two i would say that would be the like i mean it will take that much time for the second phase putting together the capital stack plus like plus the biggest biggest unknown here is that getting the financing for this without any enrollment data there is always an option like if if he's hitting the enrollment target my guess is that it will be easier for any lender to even increase their loan to value there which increase decreases the fundraising need so right now like i have assumed it like on the lower side because i know without any enrollment data like most of the lenders would be like hey we cannot go up above x percent loan to value so okay that's great yeah i mean to be honest to be really honest to don't you i mean you're in charge of the enrollment growth plan for ted because whatever you tell us to do we're going to do because we both know books i didn't i know that we just it's all building dependent and so like you don't have to pick that that was my question zach which which and again i i've written it in my notes of like things to validate is the enrollment ramp up and its validity like i can anything can look good in on excel and like we can build any number here my my bigger question is that like i i don't know enough about this development to say that like can a startup school in roll three hundred fifty students in year one i think that doesn't make me nervous because there were other models where we basically had to get to all twelve hundred kids by year five or something and you know in my head i was like i wasn't sure if you got to get to the whole enrollment to be able to afford any of this and so you want to raise the twelve hundred that made me kind of sick to my stomach i think that it like this is this is not this is basically what marc arzano is proposing and they're a charter application that they get to about six hundred by year by twenty twenty nine i think that that's got to be doable because i think that that's not doable this whole thing is going to crumble and i think we're we're different we're going to make ted have to find money for some transportation so like it's we're forcing him to put a meaningful number of his budget in transportation so that he can until the development is fully built out he can run buses in competition with all of you know d forty nine and even d twenty if he's good so i think that that's really doable i would prefer right whatever the slowest growth plan that you think is works that's what i would prefer because i don't know i don't like these like we're going to get a thousand kids within three years so i think you if you tell me whatever the ideal growth plan is i'm just going to ask you is that is that the slowest that we can do and if you say yes then i'm just going to work with ted and we're going to backwards plan from that growth plan yeah so zach like again without knowing like the school model or or the structure again i can assume based on what i know but my guess is that this this portion so csp is i i've assumed around one point eight million and then my guess is and based on what we have typically seen this will require another two to three million dollars just the operating total or per year oh but total yeah yeah because because you are going in a permanent facility yeah so there will be like some operating gap like because in your initial years you are spending significantly higher so this has to this has to get covered through some startup funding and that is where so this number and this number like we'll have to whoever we are going to for fundraising we'll have to present the whole package because one doesn't work without the other well i would just say the high level and i've got it sorry i've got a hard stop at nine thirty this is super helpful i mean this is really really helpful sudanshu and i think that if you guys can kind of figure out how to chris knows how to repeat these decks but maybe you know no no i'm going to simplify and like again like that was my goal for like validating some of these things with you is that if for norwood like i want to present like a very clear ask and very clear what needs to be true from like other fundraising standpoint what i'm gonna i'm gonna push for pretty hard not that i have any leverage in any of this right it's just that if we do this i would really like that there's a commitment to at least try one bond or mill campaign and be forty nine in the next like three cycles because i still think that if you get that it just solves a lot of problems unless you guys say to me you know how to raise five to ten million dollars for a single school philanthropy outside of colorado springs because this is basically what we're doing with the healthcare school right now where we're saying if bloomberg comes in at five to ten we can kind of do whatever we want if bloomberg doesn't come in we have to do a completely different plan with tracy like it's not even the same school and i think for us we just need to know from kind of your side zach right now my answer to that question is no because like right now i only know dsst to be able to pull this off yeah exactly and dsst has been around for so many years to be able to do it i don't have any other parallels or even my conversations with anshuts and like all the other people who have give to dsst i don't know if they have enough then i would like to frame this almost as we have to take we have to yeah so that's why i was like i wanted to and i need to double check this assumption with lydia again so that then i can frame it as like what needs to be true is bond campaign for this to work yeah and it could be bond or mill to be or mill sorry yeah that terminology like atlas got an extra five percent of their operating funds and yeah that's great because that's that's just my assumption too sudan too is that if we do this we have to have a commitment that csf norwood and legacy are all okay with trying to work with e forty nine in twenty six twenty eight indoor thirty to do something because i just don't i don't have any confidence that ted can raise five million dollars after what you guys put in and what csp puts in after what nora puts in he could get to like a million bucks but if he's got to get to five to seven million dollars in philanthropy i would i would advise him not to do this project because i just don't i couldn't raise that money myself and so i yeah so zach like i think that is the like there are i have taken a list of things to validate to give you an answer to that question in and i'm targeting at least let's say a month for you to get clarity on on this because it requires norwood input it requires like talking to some of the construction like validating construction cost understanding enrollment like all those pieces but again at least like this exercise helped me focus on like hey these are the five things we need to know before we can say a yes or a no to your question i would say through on the construction side you know how frugal brittany is i would call her i would just talk to her about what her assumptions were with that middle school project because she's one of the best when it comes to actually executing these building things like not at your level of financial complexity but like she knows what pink costs and what and she fights truth and nail with everybody over every dollar and so to me if she's like hey the least amount you could build one of these is four hundred fifty i would probably take her out of her word because she knows like even though she had to do some hoops like they just opened that building and i just can't imagine maybe you did a little bit of discount but anyways this is awesome so i'm just gonna tell eric this is what's coming with you guys their conversations with you full capital stack suganchu has the full complexity and roughly you're gonna have they're gonna have to donate land and pre development services and then we're gonna all have to agree to go after a bond ish and it's possible like that's all i'm gonna tell i think that's that's the if that is the base case scenario we are starting with i think this is doable but but if bond doesn't happen is the open question which we need to kind of figure out like in that scenario how do we still work this out yeah that's great okay thank you for all those thanks so helpful awesome thanks zach i will summarize this and then we'll touch base i think in a week after my conversation athletics yeah okay okay appreciate it okay and",

          "content": "hey zach how are you good after noon pretty good how are you guys wearing fair play this week yes we went there tuesday to hierarchies how about how's that going pretty good like again had more interest than they had anticipated initially in enrollment so from enrollment standpoint it was pretty good the csi approval that they got was like starting with twenty students maximum go up to thirty six they started with fifty one kids so there's like one district so the interesting thing about park county is like there's one district school but the district pans the driving distance of one and a half hour so there are families that are either homeschooling not going not sending kids to school so those are the families that kind of connect with with hierarchies they were like at least like fifteen to twenty percent of the students that were otherwise homeschooling that have come back into yeah yeah that's great so yeah it was good and then yeah i think this year they because of csp they've also like made sure they are to have a strong launch their staffing more than they initially had in the budget so all those things are helping them in terms of getting the students the only thing is like all the homeschooling kids are coming in far behind especially on the reading fluency and literacy and doing k through eight together has its own challenges so yeah yeah i was just randomly an old friend of mine is thinking about movements to salida and c school back then i was telling her about hierarchies because the charter the full charter approval and some of these small towns like we're kind of going to experience this with rebecca and grand junction can be tough because even if you're coming with one hundred or two hundred kids that's such a big percentage of the district but i was telling her that there's probably some number of like a macro micro school that if you get to it's big enough that you can afford to do it and it's not scary enough for the district that you can maybe get approval yeah the interesting thing and again i don't know the salida we can do more research into that but when we were studying the park county part so like park county in of itself doesn't have lot of like enrollment potential there's one district school but then submit county next to it in the north and then two other counties in the south they have like more than seven eight thousand students so so that is where like hierarchies did the smart thing by getting a charter approved for two hundred plus students i think two hundred fifteen students or something from csi so now like the can they afford transportation to be able to get all those kids no so so they so they basically are going to do like four different micro sites at four different location because again driving distance is the big factor for families so that's how they're thinking about so two other microsite more closer to summit counties how they're thinking okay so they'll have four micro micro sites yeah so four sites with like fifty students fourteen to fifty students so that they can get to like two hundred across the chart yeah yeah cool zach after our last conversation i kind of like ran some numbers did some math and then as we had discussed like put together like the the users and then for this call wanted to like brainstorm the sources side with you and then also like get your thoughts on like framing for norwood framing for like rest of the funders of like how to get this done so we can spend little sometime on that as well let me show so just a quick high level i think so i met with ted just to kind of get his appetite because obviously we need a leader we're going to move faster and then i think what we both talked about what's clear is that it's going to have to be the perch around site it can't be not the nord yeah there's nothing out there so he drove around on we had our check in on tuesday and i have been telling him freestyle just because i you know it's still early enough that it's all it kind of all feels conceptual and then i think after our call last friday which is great obviously like what am i doing going here we can we can't plan on a brand new ten million dollar school or ten dollar school being open in eighteen months on the development that has no roads right there are no roads there right now that's probably not going to you know fly so he drove up to percheron and they're much more it's still very new but there's homes actually there there's roads there the development i think norwood has gotten all of the development plan approved so the plan i think is like set and now they're building it and i just think for this first potential pilot site that's what i'm thinking so i reached out to eric schofield just to say hey can we get together because eric had reached out when you guys were down ironically to be like hey how about a hillsdale school right and i was like hey how about something else like right so i'm meeting with him on tuesday just to kind of get a sense to tell him just to say like this is all really big but can you work with chris to kind of give us a sense of is this at all possible that you're ready to go in mainland by the summer and the latest case right to where we can actually start building something in the next year or two just to know with them that we're not off by like one to three years of their development cycle so if i'm going to start having that conversation with eric at like a lower level and then i know you and lydia are going to be meeting with chris at some point this month yeah but my hope is this month that we can first confirm from that m are they even within like a standard deviation of being ready to do something of this magnitude to call a shot to donate land to do a charter to pick a fellow like that we have now or are we still kind of future casting and we've got to slow this all down and right away ted and i right we were like if nora doesn't do this she got you ted can't go to d forty nine it's just not possible because there's no there's no buildings up there and so we could get him a charter but like the only deal that he could get is a high mark deal and i don't think anybody wants that and so i think that that's where i just realized after last week from our position right like we like if norwood does something our fellow named ted knight can do something and d forty nine and he's been building towards that obviously he's you know he's written the first you know one hundred of the one hundred twenty five page application he's talked to the superintendent and then everybody but i think after our conversation last friday and when i was talking to him and we both were like you know it's not going to do that or you're not interested right because you look at and you're like this is a bad capital stack right then we've got immediately find him a different place to go because there's no facility option in d forty nine that works with that many kids with that like sixty percent not free and reduced lunch population it's just not built out and so i think that that's what we're trying to figure out in the next couple months is like is this norwood csf thing a real possibility and if not we got to pivot like really quick with him to go somewhere else yeah so no that's that's something again when i was running this i had the same conclusion so i think we are pretty aligned there the second just the clarifying question so when you say novard like if this is a possibility and if we can do something is it about the site that you had shown me or is it about the other side that already has the perch around site so does norwood have presence there and like can they donate land there so that's their other development it's just like it's one mile north okay so that also is is norwood so it will be the similar blueprint like either here or not okay it's in normal development that's actually being that actually has homes in it right okay i think you might only have fifty or one hundred homes right but it's it's approved they're building it it's come and i think when the marzano school got approved to got you i think they penciled in that they were going to buy that school site from norwood and you should i if you don't have it but percheron's p e r c h e r o n if you don't have that somewhere in email i can send you the developer i have the blank page development plan it it looks essentially like freestyle it's just a mile north and it's probably a year to three years ahead of the freestyle development got it and it has a designated like roughly twenty acre site that's going to be for school and i my gut would be is if we don't step in one of two things is going to happen either marzano or an existing charter school is going to buy it from them or eric and chris are going to run out and find a hill scale classical school and try to recruit them to come to that site that's what i would guess like if you look at me like look this all sounded great but this is just this is nuts there's no way of doing this money we looked at is that this is not we don't want to be there i just think one of the approved charters of the forty nine will buy it or eric and chris will go out and use it as bait to recruit bill scale classical network to come and then in that case i mean i do think there's a domino chain that if they were to do that and i think it's just like a possibility that then they would just be like yeah let's just copy paste this yeah yeah it's just they're all still classical it's a whole network comes yeah and for the next twenty years every time they open up development they bring hillsdale school to it yeah zach a question on so i think when we were in idaho mark had shared that one of the reasons why these new developments are partnering with charter schools versus district is that like district is moving slow it has been difficult to pass the bond and charters are getting at least some portion of their own capital and like some donation from the developer is at least getting them school which can help them sell homes i'm just curious like how's that how's that dynamics in d forty nine is there a bond yeah i mean that's where i just really appreciated yeah i don't know trip i thought it was going to be good but i think it's exact i mean it's not perfect overlay but it's almost the same this issue like d forty nine is not good like when we talk to the lance and i talk to the superintendent and we were just like hey are you thinking about a bond or a bill yeah and they're like no that's never going to happen we tried a twenty three and we got crushed and we were like well twenty three was not a good time to go and they were just like i don't know so they don't have enough money to match the growth of nullwood so they're going to be behind it but then i think without you guys at the table showing norwood how to do this in a different way norwood would either just i mean honestly they would just sell the land to marzano and be like they have to deliver however they're doing it with highmark right and they would probably have somehow that if you don't deliver a school i don't know they can rebuy it going i don't know how developers do that but nobody norwood doesn't have the money to build the schools and the district doesn't have the money to build those goals and i think that that's certainly the case i mean i think that miners you being at the table or us being at the table nor would just have sold these pieces to these classical schools they would have bootstrapped it but that bootstrap would have come at the cost of basically any low income kid amenities that you need to transportation outreach whatever and it would just be is probably rich as possible to match the brand new development that that's what i would guess because i think that that's what we saw with marzano's charter presentation is i'm guessing kymark can step in and tell everybody it's super doable and then the weight of that all just goes to the marzano folks and if they deliver they deliver it if not marziana owns the land and sells it to somebody else yeah okay i'm starting with the thesis that percheron site has development requires a school either it can be a marzano school or xyz classical school or hillsdale yeah or but there is a need and like we want to compete to make sure or we want to present a plan which is in partnership with norwood like is more doable than other options so that we can have the high chance yeah okay yeah and there's not actually what's the nice thing about the percheron side is when you go like one mile i don't know it's like maybe it's three miles it's not that far but once you go like one standard deviation north there's no charter school out there down by freestyle there's a school called rocky mountain classical that's already full on the west side of it there's so much growth coming that there could easily be another one down there but the nice thing about percheron is the closest one is being in academy and that was built for the danny lewis development and that's completely full so whoever gets to percheron and i think this is probably why marzano was so bullish or high mark was bullish with them as whoever gets the percheron first will have kids yeah would be my guest so last question on this like do we know where is marzano on all this right now like are they moving quickly we talked to them i mean i think the good thing is we got to we got to norwood soon enough that they have not they've not offered made committed to them yet yeah and then eric's email last week made it sound like an i'll confirm this on tuesday just some very basic things but it made it sound like they're they would even be more interested in just finding like a hillsdale school than just selling to marzano i picked up a vibe that they didn't love the marzano approach for whatever reason i don't know if it's because they want something so much more conservative without seeing a lot of things or not but yeah so those are the kind of three players i think that that's enough like for the thesis to kind of work out the hypothesis right that yeah if we move quickly we might be able to yeah we still have a chance okay okay this is super helpful context i think my question on enrollment i mean we'll have to dig more deep with brian on this but at least like knowing that it's not the empty side like gives me more more comfort and then the second question i had in my need to validate list was around the district bond which also you answered so and what i would say is bryce what is i think important that you can't write it into the model right because it's not you can't bank on it but i think there's an assumption that i have which is to make all of this just way less stressful for everybody right is if the ideal case would be is if we could do the pilot with ted affair and try to convince chris that like if we do this and they worked with you to create a more complex capital stack we shouldn't take a couple bites at the apple with that bond campaign and if it's not twenty six we should do it in twenty eight with the presidential it would be so ridiculous for that district to not go in twenty eight unless the economy is in like a depression and i think that that's where if you can somehow do it without the bond but have something that if the bond hits everybody gets made whole i don't know how you guys do that or how the complexity of that all shakes out but that's what i think everybody should do because that could be a huge win for csf norwood and the district and obviously the school because the school is going to need more like they're going to need at least two of these twenty twenty five million dollar buildings to be able to fit well three yeah ok so the bond part anyway for the phase one i had not included in any scenario and then for phase two it was one of the options that i had but we can we can talk through that as we get into this let me can you give me access to ok so zach i started with one like long term affordability because if it doesn't work in the long term like it will be i mean we can put lot of effort fixing it in the short term but then it will get stuck at some point so i started with that to say that ok across the two phases to serve twelve hundred students what would be the maximum cost that school can afford based on average costing and then what are the levels that we then need to pull to get it to schools affordability range either on the financing side or on the partnership side or other things but like at least this helped me lay out of like what is the need or like what is the gap that we need to figure out with different levers again fourteen thousand is not a d forty nine today revenue it is lower than that but again looking at like twenty thirty and beyond when it will be at full scale so fields conservative but still so this basically looking at that if school spends twelve percent of the revenue on facilities dead service the total cost project cost that they can afford like total debt is around twenty six million but around total project cost taking out all the financing other expenses is around twenty five million dollars is is what school can afford on its own now this was just again the starting point so like let's say if school goes out to finance this debt they can get twenty five million now this was very top down of like ok school spends twelve percent this is what they can do now then i did the bottoms up calculation i took out like all the knowledge i had about gem prep elevate all the other idaho schools to look at like what is their kind of square foot for like total number of students and like did all the math and understanding there i think for them it is between seventy to eighty five square foot per student is the building that they develop elevate is higher elevate is around one hundred ten because they have this technical building backside so they are around one hundred one hundred twenty but gem was more around eighty seventy to eighty five kind of use that as the base here for us for ted again we can change these numbers debate that but for the purpose of this exercise i think it was around sixty thousand square foot in phase one and then around forty forty five thousand dollars square foot in the phase two development was seven hundred and five hundred students again this is for discussion so we can change these numbers as we talk but this was my base case which i had developed so again this was the hard and soft cost not the other contingency and like other things but like this is what i have looked at again idaho projects are below that i think elevate was around two hundred eighty gm was around two hundred ninety so those were the things that we had but this is something that i need to validate and like we need to do more work on but based on something like this yeah i was going to say the good test case and that i've been thinking about as atlas just built their middle school the best grant right and that middle school project was somewhere around forty forty five thousand square feet yeah and that cost twenty five million dollars so i think and they already owned the land pretty frugal i mean you've now brittany right so i've just been using my head that you're probably going to get lucky in colorado springs to be at five hundred dollars a square foot in construction after you factor in the land costs factoring the land cost ok the only thing which happens with best grant like if you have received the best grant and you are getting the reimbursement i think and this was the thing that i faced in california a lot was like you have to go through if you're getting a federal or like a best kind of grant you have to go through like prevailing wage which increases the project budget by almost thirty percent it was around thirty five percent in california so that was another thing which we have to kind of figure out of like i mean thirty percent is a big number on five hundred like it will be around one hundred fifty dollars so i think that is like if we are not relying on a best kind of grand and if we can go directly that is where we can save on overall cost so instead of like twenty five million and i think the only thing that we talked about this last time is like and i fully agree with that could be twenty thirty percent just you have to do it because of how you have to do it invest yeah there's a norm quality preference taste tax but then also balance that out you could ignore what lights nice stuff and like that will also you just have that in the back of your mind that like you know norwood will want my assumption is normal to want these things to look at least ten percent nicer than what you know the charter would just be like we're totally fine it's a box it passes it has classrooms and passes like you know right inspections but this one i'm pretty sure test that as you talk with them about just there because chris is doing a lot with the palmer project right now sudan he took a whole like team he paid for like thirty people from colorado springs to go out to visit like historical beautiful buildings and on the east coast last year ahead of the palmer thing and like he's a part of that in that high school they have slated for two hundred million dollars and so it's not he's not going to want that on a charter but you'll just you'll want to feel that out i don't know but you'll want to feel that out because they're not always costco conservative type developer that's like you know very efficient they are very efficient but sometimes they like nice things yeah no which is which again depending on how big the hole is like we'll have to manage their expectation as well so that's why like this exercise was like okay if you want to do your quality like put it like make it closer to seven hundred and let's see what the hole is and then and then like if you want to save like this is what we typically look at so holes are going to be big i mean i like this because i'm like basically this even if it's this right they're going to be in the ballpark of forty to fifty million dollars right like even if like copy those and then you know i know you didn't get to it yet but like then it's going to be at least twice the the first math shows you they can afford at twenty five million right so so then then like the phase two i basically increased the price because it always does so so this was the phase two so now again we need to pressure test this assumption there is a trade off here clear trade off here around quality amenities all the things that we want to figure out but let's start with this number and we can keep playing with this number to come back to what we want so looking at that i kind of built the sources and users here for phase one and phase two so phase one again this is more of the predef cost of like initially working getting the site all those things and then this was just the land cost and other things that i have just named again these are the numbers to be tested but this number is basically donations of whatever price this gets to it will get adjusted here but then this was the construction cost and then some financing costs so it was around twenty six million dollars for phase one and then for the phase two like you in three years if you do that like the total cost is somewhere around forty million dollars is what what we have right now now again it's showing forty three million dollars because it it doesn't it includes the land and everything so that will be donated but let's say i think five million was the total indonesia okay so this was the affordability and this is where the project cost is landing across two faces i think the whole right now is around seventeen million dollars right so let's say five million is is donated there is still like a twelve million dollar gap that we need to figure out if if this works so so now then i again and then what are the levers that we have like there is some financing levers that we can pull but i think based on what i understand i think either either the fundraising bond or school increasing the spend on facilities are the three biggest drivers here financing might solve for like the short term but not for the long term for now so i think those were the three three levers that we had so the first lever which is more on ted's control is can they increase the spend instead of twelve percent to let's say fourteen on facilities for for comparison like idaho spends around fifteen sixteen to seventeen percent is what this kind because their ppr is also like much lower around nine thousand five hundred dollars is their property you've been selling fellows to do twenty just because we we can't fix twenty is everything zach like it will also might include the operating regular operating cost which is around four to five percent so if i just do the debt service part of it should be fourteen to fifteen percent so if we increase that let's say fifteen percent is what we do that so it it brings it reduces the need by around six million dollars overall so the the whole right now is around six point five million dollars you're right this is the i mean you this is the entire colorado spring story of charter schools in a nutshell right which is this is why we've never had any good equitable schools and we haven't even had any yeah if if like the school is spending fifty to fifteen percent of the revenue like it's it's coming at a cost of your program end of the day so what we don't exist no i'm saying they don't oh they don't exist yeah yeah yeah this is why none of we have no there's only one atlas in the whole city is because we didn't do this we went out and raised a bunch of money and we took out a tremendous amount of debt and then we passed the mill in a bond and then that's why now atlas exists and then the vanguard tca all the classical schools they started in the worst ugliest buildings where they like leased trailers and like thirty years later they finally you know had a modest building and so i think that that's that because in a nutshell in colorado springs you can't you know no schools ever raised five million dollars in plants b not one and no schools ever raised twelve million dollars in flint yeah so again like that is something that we are trying to fix but again there's no like one source that will fill everything so i'm i was just trying to see like okay and again if the bond or mill comes like lot of this will get solved like if if the school gets ten million even ten million dollars allocation from the bond like it significantly solves the need but i was like okay in the other scenario where like the bond is not the plug what do we do here so so that was that is what was trying to solve and i think that that right like i think that's what i would say right is like and and that assumes that you can really hold the three to four hundred a square foot what i don't know right which you'll have to tell me because you're also used to working in either richer markets or bigger state markets that have like bigger state funding per school maybe for grants foundations that are jcaf or growth funds or whatever so like that's the that's the thing zach like so jcaf didn't solve for the affordability for any of these schools like they only did the short term like whatever they did with building hope was only solving for the short term affordability problem not the long term affordability problem they didn't put they didn't put any equity in the building for any of the schools what is the way that idaho is solving for it so idaho basically is like their total project cost is around fifteen sixteen million dollars for their six hundred five to six hundred student schools right and and how they are doing it is basically yeah so that is the another level that i wanted to talk about which can solve is on the financing side is this right right now assuming like what's the current market rate for a typical cdfi loan now if the school gets eligible for moral obligation if there is some capital stack where we can leverage norwood's balance sheet or some kind of guarantee this is another level like instead of again one of the schools here just three months back got a loan for five point one percent so so if you do that what is that yeah so if i if i reduce it to let's say five percent and maturity on thirty five years because this is typically like what you can get if you have moral obligation you are in surplus here like so this if you go to fifteen percent and you get five nine bucks yeah if you go to fifteen percent yeah how did you get that how do you get that number this this number is basically yeah so this again schools are still getting this number for their long term financing so it's not completely like a concept that i'm talking about crown point academy just got five point one percent on their long term issue thirty five years because they had like they had an operating history and and certain financial position they applied for credit rating and they got the moral obligation state credit enhancement which basically reduced eric duran from from am i blanking short on the name we don't want to work with them but da davidson da davidson so he told me that he got a deal for one of the big charter school more classical kind at four point seven five percent so again these are not the concept numbers like we can get there and and kind of make it to some affordability this is another level that we can we need to figure out like we want to make sure that ted is hitting those financial targets to in five years to be able to qualify for this and then does the one that we went through that was idaho classical when they because they they needed that that phase two construction to start almost like immediately right catch up to their like like how how are how are they solving that where it's so again they're going for a short term financing now and like that is something that we will be discussing with norwood so short term financing how it works in idaho is that they get sixty five percent of the total cost as loan from the bank banks bank loans there are somewhere around five to five point five percent right now in in idaho same as here and then like basically over last five to seven years jcaf bloom and all the charter schools have made an effort and have created a revolving loan fund with idaho state so they provide two and a half million dollars at zero percent interest rate ecosystem that takes time to build with all these tools right that you help people set up i think one of the things just for today is you know i i understand no so again like again all those revolving loan funds equivalent of that and other things we can we can figure out and we can get to make it work in the short term i i'm not too worried about i think when you combine like right the norwood piece your guys's piece the the fast construction timeline right because maybe if all like if you and lydia and norwood and his head and us and lance sit down with peter at b forty ninth maybe there's some world where they allow us to get approved and you know april instead of june but i think for today i just wanted to get at a high level do you think it's possible to do this complex of a deal not not ever i think it's possible for sure ever but like where like kids would actually be walking into a new building in twenty months yeah none of this is yeah so i think i think it is possible the only three big variables that i wanted to get an understanding from you which we talked about was not from you like we have to do little more work to to for me to firmly give you that answer is the the construction cost like what i've assumed like if it is like two and a half times or two times twice of this i don't think this will work so so getting clarity on like hey am i working with the right numbers is forty million dollar building is what we are talking about for the school or are we talking about eighty billion dollar today so so that what would you make for three hundred fifty and the four hundred so i would say in in aurora the project that dsst or ast aurora science and technology is working on the total project cost there for eleven hundred students is fifty five million dollars okay so but again it's a it's a district building and they are going through they're building it to the standards of a new builder now it's a new build fresh like completely new build in a new upcoming development there yeah aurora highline so somewhere in the ballpark forty to fifty million but but their square footage would at least be one hundred twenty square foot per student yeah because it's it's it's a district like district is building that and owning is this a fair way to say this because i think there's a simple thing that i want to say to eric next week and also ted but if norwood were to donate the land and basically a million dollars worth of pre development services to be all in and let's say five million csf and legacy could match that five million from somebody else or another five million of grants and if we did that there's a project here and if we did that we could even try to get some of that money back in some complex way down the road if there's a bond pass is that a fair sentence yeah this is the the plug that five million dollars we have to fill if considering school is yeah and if we don't get a bond if we got a bond i would be hoping we get a lot more than six million dollars but if we don't get a bond that number we have to raise in blank yeah that's true yeah that's the to have any chance of making this even close to possible that sounds that's about right or does that is that include also the five percent is that five point eight yeah no five dollars you wrote into the first tab sorry so can you repeat that if you go back to that other tab where you put in an extra five million dollars of philanthropy in phase two yeah the affordability tab where you with that five million dollars right there this is basically the the land the land and norwood norwood basically land and and predef whatever they are going to put in this okay so that that assumes that we need that and then if we got a bond or well what happens if you if that number so if you assume norma gives the land and the pre development work at five and then you raise another five million dollars just so then school so then school will will have to will not have to spend fourteen percent of their revenue on facility only twelve you don't need five million from norwood five million from grant and five billion dollars from bonds you just need a total of about eight to ten million yeah this this is my gap that i'm solving for okay all right so total gap that i'm solving for so like the three livers that i was trying to pull is like how much norwood can give how much school can increase the annual spend so that they can raise more debt or bond was it my third big driver i think the fourth other driver is just the capital stack innovation which increase decreases the interest rate and brings this number down to let's say seven eight million dollars versus eleven yeah so those are the four those are the four things that we need to figure out yeah roughly it's a roughly fifty million dollars project that if we get five from norwood and five from somewhere else and do innovative things we have a chance of doing this no so the total project cost is around forty three to forty five million dollars let's let's anchor on forty five million dollars and this forty and school can basically afford around twenty five million dollars sorry you already adjusted the interest rate up top yeah that's with the five percent yeah so overall like this is the gap that exists now this can be solved like we'll have to pull all the other levers that we have is let me actually change this to let's say bond other philanthropy yeah school increase cool i don't see a world if we can't get a waste of five norwood's not going to put in five million if we can't match it with five million of something so i think that's where that has to be five because they won't do it if no one's going to match it yeah and then school increasing either school increases something or we decrease the interest rate here yeah you make that two percent what is what do we get to right off the bat so where are we yeah so we're in the ballpark and then the better rate would not get yeah and the better rate will knock it down further so yeah if we okay that's helpful because then i'm just going to kind of say like it's yeah we need five but if norwood what happens to donchu if norwood's able to get a higher appraisal of the land does that help if the land is artificially appraised higher does that help much or not really not really it's just that yeah we can we can probably say a few basis points here because the equity contribution is more yeah not significant yeah yeah okay because then then that is yeah yeah that is because right now what what i'm assuming here is like everything that is donated so whatever is the increase there is basically cancelling of indonesia so you don't have any cash from norwood in this model right this one donated services yeah this one no no other cash yeah but that five million is in cash right no this basically is total of this will just cut this off and i don't know if they do that or have the crap but if they did all the pre development and site work and donated the land and never gave you a dollar of cash yeah this is this is what this is what it assumes there's no cash on top of what these three things got it okay when you you've done a ton of these what how do you score how possible this is to all pull off in twenty months the financing side of this can be pulled i think like the biggest again let me go back to this one this is the biggest one which i'm not sure of oh sorry yeah this one yeah and that we need to like norwood i don't we'll find out you guys don't i think so this basically means the land donation so this is not additional but they have to do it or there's no project yeah yeah that that that is that is a given like yeah that has to be done otherwise there's no cons norwood land yeah okay so that was an assumption that has to get checked yeah yeah and and this is basically in schools control of how they come out sudashir how much time do you do what we have to find the second five million like we have to know norwood's five million soon now no we no we can we can go ahead with the first we can potentially go ahead with our phase one the phase one if if if we have all this in place i think the biggest challenge would be to make the short term affordability work and that is where our our grant funding and csp will basically solve for it yeah yeah okay and then would you have a year two years three years so again like that is that is that is a piece which i wanted to like again that would be a ted question right now my thinking this was something which i had in like if you are doing like a seven hundred student phase one and five hundred student phase two this is this is what i had in idaho basically built their buildings so they could have the full k eight phase one covered the full case so so jim actually tried both options they did the full build in one go they tried breaking it down i think for them like because they start with like k through two and five six or like six seven great and then build it out for them like space was space planning didn't work out well so they go for the whole thing together what would you recommend like if ted could film way more kids sooner should he do that or should he slow it down so you have time to raise the capital stack for phase two i would say that would be the like i mean it will take that much time for the second phase putting together the capital stack plus like plus the biggest biggest unknown here is that getting the financing for this without any enrollment data there is always an option like if if he's hitting the enrollment target my guess is that it will be easier for any lender to even increase their loan to value there which increase decreases the fundraising need so right now like i have assumed it like on the lower side because i know without any enrollment data like most of the lenders would be like hey we cannot go up above x percent loan to value so okay that's great yeah i mean to be honest to be really honest to don't you i mean you're in charge of the enrollment growth plan for ted because whatever you tell us to do we're going to do because we both know books i didn't i know that we just it's all building dependent and so like you don't have to pick that that was my question zach which which and again i i've written it in my notes of like things to validate is the enrollment ramp up and its validity like i can anything can look good in on excel and like we can build any number here my my bigger question is that like i i don't know enough about this development to say that like can a startup school in roll three hundred fifty students in year one i think that doesn't make me nervous because there were other models where we basically had to get to all twelve hundred kids by year five or something and you know in my head i was like i wasn't sure if you got to get to the whole enrollment to be able to afford any of this and so you want to raise the twelve hundred that made me kind of sick to my stomach i think that it like this is this is not this is basically what marc arzano is proposing and they're a charter application that they get to about six hundred by year by twenty twenty nine i think that that's got to be doable because i think that that's not doable this whole thing is going to crumble and i think we're we're different we're going to make ted have to find money for some transportation so like it's we're forcing him to put a meaningful number of his budget in transportation so that he can until the development is fully built out he can run buses in competition with all of you know d forty nine and even d twenty if he's good so i think that that's really doable i would prefer right whatever the slowest growth plan that you think is works that's what i would prefer because i don't know i don't like these like we're going to get a thousand kids within three years so i think you if you tell me whatever the ideal growth plan is i'm just going to ask you is that is that the slowest that we can do and if you say yes then i'm just going to work with ted and we're going to backwards plan from that growth plan yeah so zach like again without knowing like the school model or or the structure again i can assume based on what i know but my guess is that this this portion so csp is i i've assumed around one point eight million and then my guess is and based on what we have typically seen this will require another two to three million dollars just the operating total or per year oh but total yeah yeah because because you are going in a permanent facility yeah so there will be like some operating gap like because in your initial years you are spending significantly higher so this has to this has to get covered through some startup funding and that is where so this number and this number like we'll have to whoever we are going to for fundraising we'll have to present the whole package because one doesn't work without the other well i would just say the high level and i've got it sorry i've got a hard stop at nine thirty this is super helpful i mean this is really really helpful sudanshu and i think that if you guys can kind of figure out how to chris knows how to repeat these decks but maybe you know no no i'm going to simplify and like again like that was my goal for like validating some of these things with you is that if for norwood like i want to present like a very clear ask and very clear what needs to be true from like other fundraising standpoint what i'm gonna i'm gonna push for pretty hard not that i have any leverage in any of this right it's just that if we do this i would really like that there's a commitment to at least try one bond or mill campaign and be forty nine in the next like three cycles because i still think that if you get that it just solves a lot of problems unless you guys say to me you know how to raise five to ten million dollars for a single school philanthropy outside of colorado springs because this is basically what we're doing with the healthcare school right now where we're saying if bloomberg comes in at five to ten we can kind of do whatever we want if bloomberg doesn't come in we have to do a completely different plan with tracy like it's not even the same school and i think for us we just need to know from kind of your side zach right now my answer to that question is no because like right now i only know dsst to be able to pull this off yeah exactly and dsst has been around for so many years to be able to do it i don't have any other parallels or even my conversations with anshuts and like all the other people who have give to dsst i don't know if they have enough then i would like to frame this almost as we have to take we have to yeah so that's why i was like i wanted to and i need to double check this assumption with lydia again so that then i can frame it as like what needs to be true is bond campaign for this to work yeah and it could be bond or mill to be or mill sorry yeah that terminology like atlas got an extra five percent of their operating funds and yeah that's great because that's that's just my assumption too sudan too is that if we do this we have to have a commitment that csf norwood and legacy are all okay with trying to work with e forty nine in twenty six twenty eight indoor thirty to do something because i just don't i don't have any confidence that ted can raise five million dollars after what you guys put in and what csp puts in after what nora puts in he could get to like a million bucks but if he's got to get to five to seven million dollars in philanthropy i would i would advise him not to do this project because i just don't i couldn't raise that money myself and so i yeah so zach like i think that is the like there are i have taken a list of things to validate to give you an answer to that question in and i'm targeting at least let's say a month for you to get clarity on on this because it requires norwood input it requires like talking to some of the construction like validating construction cost understanding enrollment like all those pieces but again at least like this exercise helped me focus on like hey these are the five things we need to know before we can say a yes or a no to your question i would say through on the construction side you know how frugal brittany is i would call her i would just talk to her about what her assumptions were with that middle school project because she's one of the best when it comes to actually executing these building things like not at your level of financial complexity but like she knows what pink costs and what and she fights truth and nail with everybody over every dollar and so to me if she's like hey the least amount you could build one of these is four hundred fifty i would probably take her out of her word because she knows like even though she had to do some hoops like they just opened that building and i just can't imagine maybe you did a little bit of discount but anyways this is awesome so i'm just gonna tell eric this is what's coming with you guys their conversations with you full capital stack suganchu has the full complexity and roughly you're gonna have they're gonna have to donate land and pre development services and then we're gonna all have to agree to go after a bond ish and it's possible like that's all i'm gonna tell i think that's that's the if that is the base case scenario we are starting with i think this is doable but but if bond doesn't happen is the open question which we need to kind of figure out like in that scenario how do we still work this out yeah that's great okay thank you for all those thanks so helpful awesome thanks zach i will summarize this and then we'll touch base i think in a week after my conversation athletics yeah okay okay appreciate it okay and three thirty",

        "summary": "hey zach how are you good after noon pretty good how are you guys wearing fair play this week yes we went there tuesday to hierarchies how about how's that going pretty good like again had more interest than they had anticipated initially in enrollment so from enrollment standpoint it was pretty good the csi approval that they got was like starting with twenty students maximum go up to thirty six they started with fifty one kids so there's like one district so the interesting thing about park county is like there's one district school but the district pans the driving distance of one and a half hour so there are families that are either homeschooling not going not sending kids to school so those are the families that kind of connect with with hierarchies they were like at least like fifteen to twenty percent of the students that were otherwise homeschooling that have come back into yeah yeah that's great so yeah it was good and then yeah i think this year they because of csp they've also like made sure they are to have a strong launch their staffing more than they initially had in the budget so all those things are helping them in terms of getting the students the only thing is like all the homeschooling kids are coming in far behind especially on the reading fluency and literacy and doing k through eight together has its own challenges so yeah yeah i was just randomly an old friend of mine is thinking about movements to salida and c school back then i was telling her about hierarchies because the charter the full charter approval and some of these small towns like we're kind of going to experience this with rebecca and grand junction can be tough because even if you're coming with one hundred or two hundred kids that's such a big percentage of the district but i was telling her that there's probably some number of like a macro micro school that if you get to it's big enough that you can afford to do it and it's not scary enough for the district that you can maybe get approval yeah the interesting thing and again i don't know the salida we can do more research into that but when we were studying the park county part so like park county in of itself doesn't have lot of like enrollment potential there's one district school but then submit county next to it in the north and then two other counties in the south they have like more than seven eight thousand students so so that is where like hierarchies did the smart thing by getting a charter approved for two hundred plus students i think two hundred fifteen students or something from csi so now like the can they afford transportation to be able to get all those kids no so so they so they basically are going to do like four different micro sites at four different location because again driving distance is the big factor for families so that's how they're thinking about so two other microsite more closer to summit counties how they're thinking okay so they'll have four micro micro sites yeah so four sites with like fifty students fourteen to fifty students so that they can get to like two hundred across the chart yeah yeah cool zach after our last conversation i kind of like ran some numbers did some math and then as we had discussed like put together like the the users and then for this call wanted to like brainstorm the sources side with you and then also like get your thoughts on like framing for norwood framing for like rest of the funders of like how to get this done so we can spend little sometime on that as well let me show so just a quick high level i think so i met with ted just to kind of get his appetite because obviously we need a leader we're going to move faster and then i think what we both talked about what's clear is that it's going to have to be the perch around site it can't be not the nord yeah there's nothing out there so he drove around on we had our check in on tuesday and i have been telling him freestyle just because i you know it's still early enough that it's all it kind of all feels conceptual and then i think after our call last friday which is great obviously like what am i doing going here we can we can't plan on a brand new ten million dollar school or ten dollar school being open in eighteen months on the development that has no roads right there are no roads there right now that's probably not going to you know fly so he drove up to percheron and they're much more it's still very new but there's homes actually there there's roads there the development i think norwood has gotten all of the development plan approved so the plan i think is like set and now they're building it and i just think for this first potential pilot site that's what i'm thinking so i reached out to eric schofield just to say hey can we get together because eric had reached out when you guys were down ironically to be like hey how about a hillsdale school right and i was like hey how about something else like right so i'm meeting with him on tuesday just to kind of get a sense to tell him just to say like this is all really big but can you work with chris to kind of give us a sense of is this at all possible that you're ready to go in mainland by the summer and the latest case right to where we can actually start building something in the next year or two just to know with them that we're not off by like one to three years of their development cycle so if i'm going to start having that conversation with eric at like a lower level and then i know you and lydia are going to be meeting with chris at some point this month yeah but my hope is this month that we can first confirm from that m are they even within like a standard deviation of being ready to do something of this magnitude to call a shot to donate land to do a charter to pick a fellow like that we have now or are we still kind of future casting and we've got to slow this all down and right away ted and i right we were like if nora doesn't do this she got you ted can't go to d forty nine it's just not possible because there's no there's no buildings up there and so we could get him a charter but like the only deal that he could get is a high mark deal and i don't think anybody wants that and so i think that that's where i just realized after last week from our position right like we like if norwood does something our fellow named ted knight can do something and d forty nine and he's been building towards that obviously he's you know he's written the first you know one hundred of the one hundred twenty five page application he's talked to the superintendent and then everybody but i think after our conversation last friday and when i was talking to him and we both were like you know it's not going to do that or you're not interested right because you look at and you're like this is a bad capital stack right then we've got immediately find him a different place to go because there's no facility option in d forty nine that works with that many kids with that like sixty percent not free and reduced lunch population it's just not built out and so i think that that's what we're trying to figure out in the next couple months is like is this norwood csf thing a real possibility and if not we got to pivot like really quick with him to go somewhere else yeah so no that's that's something again when i was running this i had the same conclusion so i think we are pretty aligned there the second just the clarifying question so when you say novard like if this is a possibility and if we can do something is it about the site that you had shown me or is it about the other side that already has the perch around site so does norwood have presence there and like can they donate land there so that's their other development it's just like it's one mile north okay so that also is is norwood so it will be the similar blueprint like either here or not okay it's in normal development that's actually being that actually has homes in it right okay i think you might only have fifty or one hundred homes right but it's it's approved they're building it it's come and i think when the marzano school got approved to got you i think they penciled in that they were going to buy that school site from norwood and you should i if you don't have it but percheron's p e r c h e r o n if you don't have that somewhere in email i can send you the developer i have the blank page development plan it it looks essentially like freestyle it's just a mile north and it's probably a year to three years ahead of the freestyle development got it and it has a designated like roughly twenty acre site that's going to be for school and i my gut would be is if we don't step in one of two things is going to happen either marzano or an existing charter school is going to buy it from them or eric and chris are going to run out and find a hill scale classical school and try to recruit them to come to that site that's what i would guess like if you look at me like look this all sounded great but this is just this is nuts there's no way of doing this money we looked at is that this is not we don't want to be there i just think one of the approved charters of the forty nine will buy it or eric and chris will go out and use it as bait to recruit bill scale classical network to come and then in that case i mean i do think there's a domino chain that if they were to do that and i think it's just like a possibility that then they would just be like yeah let's just copy paste this yeah yeah it's just they're all still classical it's a whole network comes yeah and for the next twenty years every time they open up development they bring hillsdale school to it yeah zach a question on so i think when we were in idaho mark had shared that one of the reasons why these new developments are partnering with charter schools versus district is that like district is moving slow it has been difficult to pass the bond and charters are getting at least some portion of their own capital and like some donation from the developer is at least getting them school which can help them sell homes i'm just curious like how's that how's that dynamics in d forty nine is there a bond yeah i mean that's where i just really appreciated yeah i don't know trip i thought it was going to be good but i think it's exact i mean it's not perfect overlay but it's almost the same this issue like d forty nine is not good like when we talk to the lance and i talk to the superintendent and we were just like hey are you thinking about a bond or a bill yeah and they're like no that's never going to happen we tried a twenty three and we got crushed and we were like well twenty three was not a good time to go and they were just like i don't know so they don't have enough money to match the growth of nullwood so they're going to be behind it but then i think without you guys at the table showing norwood how to do this in a different way norwood would either just i mean honestly they would just sell the land to marzano and be like they have to deliver however they're doing it with highmark right and they would probably have somehow that if you don't deliver a school i don't know they can rebuy it going i don't know how developers do that but nobody norwood doesn't have the money to build the schools and the district doesn't have the money to build those goals and i think that that's certainly the case i mean i think that miners you being at the table or us being at the table nor would just have sold these pieces to these classical schools they would have bootstrapped it but that bootstrap would have come at the cost of basically any low income kid amenities that you need to transportation outreach whatever and it would just be is probably rich as possible to match the brand new development that that's what i would guess because i think that that's what we saw with marzano's charter presentation is i'm guessing kymark can step in and tell everybody it's super doable and then the weight of that all just goes to the marzano folks and if they deliver they deliver it if not marziana owns the land and sells it to somebody else yeah okay i'm starting with the thesis that percheron site has development requires a school either it can be a marzano school or xyz classical school or hillsdale yeah or but there is a need and like we want to compete to make sure or we want to present a plan which is in partnership with norwood like is more doable than other options so that we can have the high chance yeah okay yeah and there's not actually what's the nice thing about the percheron side is when you go like one mile i don't know it's like maybe it's three miles it's not that far but once you go like one standard deviation north there's no charter school out there down by freestyle there's a school called rocky mountain classical that's already full on the west side of it there's so much growth coming that there could easily be another one down there but the nice thing about percheron is the closest one is being in academy and that was built for the danny lewis development and that's completely full so whoever gets to percheron and i think this is probably why marzano was so bullish or high mark was bullish with them as whoever gets the percheron first will have kids yeah would be my guest so last question on this like do we know where is marzano on all this right now like are they moving quickly we talked to them i mean i think the good thing is we got to we got to norwood soon enough that they have not they've not offered made committed to them yet yeah and then eric's email last week made it sound like an i'll confirm this on tuesday just some very basic things but it made it sound like they're they would even be more interested in just finding like a hillsdale school than just selling to marzano i picked up a vibe that they didn't love the marzano approach for whatever reason i don't know if it's because they want something so much more conservative without seeing a lot of things or not but yeah so those are the kind of three players i think that that's enough like for the thesis to kind of work out the hypothesis right that yeah if we move quickly we might be able to yeah we still have a chance okay okay this is super helpful context i think my question on enrollment i mean we'll have to dig more deep with brian on this but at least like knowing that it's not the empty side like gives me more more comfort and then the second question i had in my need to validate list was around the district bond which also you answered so and what i would say is bryce what is i think important that you can't write it into the model right because it's not you can't bank on it but i think there's an assumption that i have which is to make all of this just way less stressful for everybody right is if the ideal case would be is if we could do the pilot with ted affair and try to convince chris that like if we do this and they worked with you to create a more complex capital stack we shouldn't take a couple bites at the apple with that bond campaign and if it's not twenty six we should do it in twenty eight with the presidential it would be so ridiculous for that district to not go in twenty eight unless the economy is in like a depression and i think that that's where if you can somehow do it without the bond but have something that if the bond hits everybody gets made whole i don't know how you guys do that or how the complexity of that all shakes out but that's what i think everybody should do because that could be a huge win for csf norwood and the district and obviously the school because the school is going to need more like they're going to need at least two of these twenty twenty five million dollar buildings to be able to fit well three yeah ok so the bond part anyway for the phase one i had not included in any scenario and then for phase two it was one of the options that i had but we can we can talk through that as we get into this let me can you give me access to ok so zach i started with one like long term affordability because if it doesn't work in the long term like it will be i mean we can put lot of effort fixing it in the short term but then it will get stuck at some point so i started with that to say that ok across the two phases to serve twelve hundred students what would be the maximum cost that school can afford based on average costing and then what are the levels that we then need to pull to get it to schools affordability range either on the financing side or on the partnership side or other things but like at least this helped me lay out of like what is the need or like what is the gap that we need to figure out with different levers again fourteen thousand is not a d forty nine today revenue it is lower than that but again looking at like twenty thirty and beyond when it will be at full scale so fields conservative but still so this basically looking at that if school spends twelve percent of the revenue on facilities dead service the total cost project cost that they can afford like total debt is around twenty six million but around total project cost taking out all the financing other expenses is around twenty five million dollars is is what school can afford on its own now this was just again the starting point so like let's say if school goes out to finance this debt they can get twenty five million now this was very top down of like ok school spends twelve percent this is what they can do now then i did the bottoms up calculation i took out like all the knowledge i had about gem prep elevate all the other idaho schools to look at like what is their kind of square foot for like total number of students and like did all the math and understanding there i think for them it is between seventy to eighty five square foot per student is the building that they develop elevate is higher elevate is around one hundred ten because they have this technical building backside so they are around one hundred one hundred twenty but gem was more around eighty seventy to eighty five kind of use that as the base here for us for ted again we can change these numbers debate that but for the purpose of this exercise i think it was around sixty thousand square foot in phase one and then around forty forty five thousand dollars square foot in the phase two development was seven hundred and five hundred students again this is for discussion so we can change these numbers as we talk but this was my base case which i had developed so again this was the hard and soft cost not the other contingency and like other things but like this is what i have looked at again idaho projects are below that i think elevate was around two hundred eighty gm was around two hundred ninety so those were the things that we had but this is something that i need to validate and like we need to do more work on but based on something like this yeah i was going to say the good test case and that i've been thinking about as atlas just built their middle school the best grant right and that middle school project was somewhere around forty forty five thousand square feet yeah and that cost twenty five million dollars so i think and they already owned the land pretty frugal i mean you've now brittany right so i've just been using my head that you're probably going to get lucky in colorado springs to be at five hundred dollars a square foot in construction after you factor in the land costs factoring the land cost ok the only thing which happens with best grant like if you have received the best grant and you are getting the reimbursement i think and this was the thing that i faced in california a lot was like you have to go through if you're getting a federal or like a best kind of grant you have to go through like prevailing wage which increases the project budget by almost thirty percent it was around thirty five percent in california so that was another thing which we have to kind of figure out of like i mean thirty percent is a big number on five hundred like it will be around one hundred fifty dollars so i think that is like if we are not relying on a best kind of grand and if we can go directly that is where we can save on overall cost so instead of like twenty five million and i think the only thing that we talked about this last time is like and i fully agree with that could be twenty thirty percent just you have to do it because of how you have to do it invest yeah there's a norm quality preference taste tax but then also balance that out you could ignore what lights nice stuff and like that will also you just have that in the back of your mind that like you know norwood will want my assumption is normal to want these things to look at least ten percent nicer than what you know the charter would just be like we're totally fine it's a box it passes it has classrooms and passes like you know right inspections but this one i'm pretty sure test that as you talk with them about just there because chris is doing a lot with the palmer project right now sudan he took a whole like team he paid for like thirty people from colorado springs to go out to visit like historical beautiful buildings and on the east coast last year ahead of the palmer thing and like he's a part of that in that high school they have slated for two hundred million dollars and so it's not he's not going to want that on a charter but you'll just you'll want to feel that out i don't know but you'll want to feel that out because they're not always costco conservative type developer that's like you know very efficient they are very efficient but sometimes they like nice things yeah no which is which again depending on how big the hole is like we'll have to manage their expectation as well so that's why like this exercise was like okay if you want to do your quality like put it like make it closer to seven hundred and let's see what the hole is and then and then like if you want to save like this is what we typically look at so holes are going to be big i mean i like this because i'm like basically this even if it's this right they're going to be in the ballpark of forty to fifty million dollars right like even if like copy those and then you know i know you didn't get to it yet but like then it's going to be at least twice the the first math shows you they can afford at twenty five million right so so then then like the phase two i basically increased the price because it always does so so this was the phase two so now again we need to pressure test this assumption there is a trade off here clear trade off here around quality amenities all the things that we want to figure out but let's start with this number and we can keep playing with this number to come back to what we want so looking at that i kind of built the sources and users here for phase one and phase two so phase one again this is more of the predef cost of like initially working getting the site all those things and then this was just the land cost and other things that i have just named again these are the numbers to be tested but this number is basically donations of whatever price this gets to it will get adjusted here but then this was the construction cost and then some financing costs so it was around twenty six million dollars for phase one and then for the phase two like you in three years if you do that like the total cost is somewhere around forty million dollars is what what we have right now now again it's showing forty three million dollars because it it doesn't it includes the land and everything so that will be donated but let's say i think five million was the total indonesia okay so this was the affordability and this is where the project cost is landing across two faces i think the whole right now is around seventeen million dollars right so let's say five million is is donated there is still like a twelve million dollar gap that we need to figure out if if this works so so now then i again and then what are the levers that we have like there is some financing levers that we can pull but i think based on what i understand i think either either the fundraising bond or school increasing the spend on facilities are the three biggest drivers here financing might solve for like the short term but not for the long term for now so i think those were the three three levers that we had so the first lever which is more on ted's control is can they increase the spend instead of twelve percent to let's say fourteen on facilities for for comparison like idaho spends around fifteen sixteen to seventeen percent is what this kind because their ppr is also like much lower around nine thousand five hundred dollars is their property you've been selling fellows to do twenty just because we we can't fix twenty is everything zach like it will also might include the operating regular operating cost which is around four to five percent so if i just do the debt service part of it should be fourteen to fifteen percent so if we increase that let's say fifteen percent is what we do that so it it brings it reduces the need by around six million dollars overall so the the whole right now is around six point five million dollars you're right this is the i mean you this is the entire colorado spring story of charter schools in a nutshell right which is this is why we've never had any good equitable schools and we haven't even had any yeah if if like the school is spending fifty to fifteen percent of the revenue like it's it's coming at a cost of your program end of the day so what we don't exist no i'm saying they don't oh they don't exist yeah yeah yeah this is why none of we have no there's only one atlas in the whole city is because we didn't do this we went out and raised a bunch of money and we took out a tremendous amount of debt and then we passed the mill in a bond and then that's why now atlas exists and then the vanguard tca all the classical schools they started in the worst ugliest buildings where they like leased trailers and like thirty years later they finally you know had a modest building and so i think that that's that because in a nutshell in colorado springs you can't you know no schools ever raised five million dollars in plants b not one and no schools ever raised twelve million dollars in flint yeah so again like that is something that we are trying to fix but again there's no like one source that will fill everything so i'm i was just trying to see like okay and again if the bond or mill comes like lot of this will get solved like if if the school gets ten million even ten million dollars allocation from the bond like it significantly solves the need but i was like okay in the other scenario where like the bond is not the plug what do we do here so so that was that is what was trying to solve and i think that that right like i think that's what i would say right is like and and that assumes that you can really hold the three to four hundred a square foot what i don't know right which you'll have to tell me because you're also used to working in either richer markets or bigger state markets that have like bigger state funding per school maybe for grants foundations that are jcaf or growth funds or whatever so like that's the that's the thing zach like so jcaf didn't solve for the affordability for any of these schools like they only did the short term like whatever they did with building hope was only solving for the short term affordability problem not the long term affordability problem they didn't put they didn't put any equity in the building for any of the schools what is the way that idaho is solving for it so idaho basically is like their total project cost is around fifteen sixteen million dollars for their six hundred five to six hundred student schools right and and how they are doing it is basically yeah so that is the another level that i wanted to talk about which can solve is on the financing side is this right right now assuming like what's the current market rate for a typical cdfi loan now if the school gets eligible for moral obligation if there is some capital stack where we can leverage norwood's balance sheet or some kind of guarantee this is another level like instead of again one of the schools here just three months back got a loan for five point one percent so so if you do that what is that yeah so if i if i reduce it to let's say five percent and maturity on thirty five years because this is typically like what you can get if you have moral obligation you are in surplus here like so this if you go to fifteen percent and you get five nine bucks yeah if you go to fifteen percent yeah how did you get that how do you get that number this this number is basically yeah so this again schools are still getting this number for their long term financing so it's not completely like a concept that i'm talking about crown point academy just got five point one percent on their long term issue thirty five years because they had like they had an operating history and and certain financial position they applied for credit rating and they got the moral obligation state credit enhancement which basically reduced eric duran from from am i blanking short on the name we don't want to work with them but da davidson da davidson so he told me that he got a deal for one of the big charter school more classical kind at four point seven five percent so again these are not the concept numbers like we can get there and and kind of make it to some affordability this is another level that we can we need to figure out like we want to make sure that ted is hitting those financial targets to in five years to be able to qualify for this and then does the one that we went through that was idaho classical when they because they they needed that that phase two construction to start almost like immediately right catch up to their like like how how are how are they solving that where it's so again they're going for a short term financing now and like that is something that we will be discussing with norwood so short term financing how it works in idaho is that they get sixty five percent of the total cost as loan from the bank banks bank loans there are somewhere around five to five point five percent right now in in idaho same as here and then like basically over last five to seven years jcaf bloom and all the charter schools have made an effort and have created a revolving loan fund with idaho state so they provide two and a half million dollars at zero percent interest rate ecosystem that takes time to build with all these tools right that you help people set up i think one of the things just for today is you know i i understand no so again like again all those revolving loan funds equivalent of that and other things we can we can figure out and we can get to make it work in the short term i i'm not too worried about i think when you combine like right the norwood piece your guys's piece the the fast construction timeline right because maybe if all like if you and lydia and norwood and his head and us and lance sit down with peter at b forty ninth maybe there's some world where they allow us to get approved and you know april instead of june but i think for today i just wanted to get at a high level do you think it's possible to do this complex of a deal not not ever i think it's possible for sure ever but like where like kids would actually be walking into a new building in twenty months yeah none of this is yeah so i think i think it is possible the only three big variables that i wanted to get an understanding from you which we talked about was not from you like we have to do little more work to to for me to firmly give you that answer is the the construction cost like what i've assumed like if it is like two and a half times or two times twice of this i don't think this will work so so getting clarity on like hey am i working with the right numbers is forty million dollar building is what we are talking about for the school or are we talking about eighty billion dollar today so so that what would you make for three hundred fifty and the four hundred so i would say in in aurora the project that dsst or ast aurora science and technology is working on the total project cost there for eleven hundred students is fifty five million dollars okay so but again it's a it's a district building and they are going through they're building it to the standards of a new builder now it's a new build fresh like completely new build in a new upcoming development there yeah aurora highline so somewhere in the ballpark forty to fifty million but but their square footage would at least be one hundred twenty square foot per student yeah because it's it's it's a district like district is building that and owning is this a fair way to say this because i think there's a simple thing that i want to say to eric next week and also ted but if norwood were to donate the land and basically a million dollars worth of pre development services to be all in and let's say five million csf and legacy could match that five million from somebody else or another five million of grants and if we did that there's a project here and if we did that we could even try to get some of that money back in some complex way down the road if there's a bond pass is that a fair sentence yeah this is the the plug that five million dollars we have to fill if considering school is yeah and if we don't get a bond if we got a bond i would be hoping we get a lot more than six million dollars but if we don't get a bond that number we have to raise in blank yeah that's true yeah that's the to have any chance of making this even close to possible that sounds that's about right or does that is that include also the five percent is that five point eight yeah no five dollars you wrote into the first tab sorry so can you repeat that if you go back to that other tab where you put in an extra five million dollars of philanthropy in phase two yeah the affordability tab where you with that five million dollars right there this is basically the the land the land and norwood norwood basically land and and predef whatever they are going to put in this okay so that that assumes that we need that and then if we got a bond or well what happens if you if that number so if you assume norma gives the land and the pre development work at five and then you raise another five million dollars just so then school so then school will will have to will not have to spend fourteen percent of their revenue on facility only twelve you don't need five million from norwood five million from grant and five billion dollars from bonds you just need a total of about eight to ten million yeah this this is my gap that i'm solving for okay all right so total gap that i'm solving for so like the three livers that i was trying to pull is like how much norwood can give how much school can increase the annual spend so that they can raise more debt or bond was it my third big driver i think the fourth other driver is just the capital stack innovation which increase decreases the interest rate and brings this number down to let's say seven eight million dollars versus eleven yeah so those are the four those are the four things that we need to figure out yeah roughly it's a roughly fifty million dollars project that if we get five from norwood and five from somewhere else and do innovative things we have a chance of doing this no so the total project cost is around forty three to forty five million dollars let's let's anchor on forty five million dollars and this forty and school can basically afford around twenty five million dollars sorry you already adjusted the interest rate up top yeah that's with the five percent yeah so overall like this is the gap that exists now this can be solved like we'll have to pull all the other levers that we have is let me actually change this to let's say bond other philanthropy yeah school increase cool i don't see a world if we can't get a waste of five norwood's not going to put in five million if we can't match it with five million of something so i think that's where that has to be five because they won't do it if no one's going to match it yeah and then school increasing either school increases something or we decrease the interest rate here yeah you make that two percent what is what do we get to right off the bat so where are we yeah so we're in the ballpark and then the better rate would not get yeah and the better rate will knock it down further so yeah if we okay that's helpful because then i'm just going to kind of say like it's yeah we need five but if norwood what happens to donchu if norwood's able to get a higher appraisal of the land does that help if the land is artificially appraised higher does that help much or not really not really it's just that yeah we can we can probably say a few basis points here because the equity contribution is more yeah not significant yeah yeah okay because then then that is yeah yeah that is because right now what what i'm assuming here is like everything that is donated so whatever is the increase there is basically cancelling of indonesia so you don't have any cash from norwood in this model right this one donated services yeah this one no no other cash yeah but that five million is in cash right no this basically is total of this will just cut this off and i don't know if they do that or have the crap but if they did all the pre development and site work and donated the land and never gave you a dollar of cash yeah this is this is what this is what it assumes there's no cash on top of what these three things got it okay when you you've done a ton of these what how do you score how possible this is to all pull off in twenty months the financing side of this can be pulled i think like the biggest again let me go back to this one this is the biggest one which i'm not sure of oh sorry yeah this one yeah and that we need to like norwood i don't we'll find out you guys don't i think so this basically means the land donation so this is not additional but they have to do it or there's no project yeah yeah that that that is that is a given like yeah that has to be done otherwise there's no cons norwood land yeah okay so that was an assumption that has to get checked yeah yeah and and this is basically in schools control of how they come out sudashir how much time do you do what we have to find the second five million like we have to know norwood's five million soon now no we no we can we can go ahead with the first we can potentially go ahead with our phase one the phase one if if if we have all this in place i think the biggest challenge would be to make the short term affordability work and that is where our our grant funding and csp will basically solve for it yeah yeah okay and then would you have a year two years three years so again like that is that is that is a piece which i wanted to like again that would be a ted question right now my thinking this was something which i had in like if you are doing like a seven hundred student phase one and five hundred student phase two this is this is what i had in idaho basically built their buildings so they could have the full k eight phase one covered the full case so so jim actually tried both options they did the full build in one go they tried breaking it down i think for them like because they start with like k through two and five six or like six seven great and then build it out for them like space was space planning didn't work out well so they go for the whole thing together what would you recommend like if ted could film way more kids sooner should he do that or should he slow it down so you have time to raise the capital stack for phase two i would say that would be the like i mean it will take that much time for the second phase putting together the capital stack plus like plus the biggest biggest unknown here is that getting the financing for this without any enrollment data there is always an option like if if he's hitting the enrollment target my guess is that it will be easier for any lender to even increase their loan to value there which increase decreases the fundraising need so right now like i have assumed it like on the lower side because i know without any enrollment data like most of the lenders would be like hey we cannot go up above x percent loan to value so okay that's great yeah i mean to be honest to be really honest to don't you i mean you're in charge of the enrollment growth plan for ted because whatever you tell us to do we're going to do because we both know books i didn't i know that we just it's all building dependent and so like you don't have to pick that that was my question zach which which and again i i've written it in my notes of like things to validate is the enrollment ramp up and its validity like i can anything can look good in on excel and like we can build any number here my my bigger question is that like i i don't know enough about this development to say that like can a startup school in roll three hundred fifty students in year one i think that doesn't make me nervous because there were other models where we basically had to get to all twelve hundred kids by year five or something and you know in my head i was like i wasn't sure if you got to get to the whole enrollment to be able to afford any of this and so you want to raise the twelve hundred that made me kind of sick to my stomach i think that it like this is this is not this is basically what marc arzano is proposing and they're a charter application that they get to about six hundred by year by twenty twenty nine i think that that's got to be doable because i think that that's not doable this whole thing is going to crumble and i think we're we're different we're going to make ted have to find money for some transportation so like it's we're forcing him to put a meaningful number of his budget in transportation so that he can until the development is fully built out he can run buses in competition with all of you know d forty nine and even d twenty if he's good so i think that that's really doable i would prefer right whatever the slowest growth plan that you think is works that's what i would prefer because i don't know i don't like these like we're going to get a thousand kids within three years so i think you if you tell me whatever the ideal growth plan is i'm just going to ask you is that is that the slowest that we can do and if you say yes then i'm just going to work with ted and we're going to backwards plan from that growth plan yeah so zach like again without knowing like the school model or or the structure again i can assume based on what i know but my guess is that this this portion so csp is i i've assumed around one point eight million and then my guess is and based on what we have typically seen this will require another two to three million dollars just the operating total or per year oh but total yeah yeah because because you are going in a permanent facility yeah so there will be like some operating gap like because in your initial years you are spending significantly higher so this has to this has to get covered through some startup funding and that is where so this number and this number like we'll have to whoever we are going to for fundraising we'll have to present the whole package because one doesn't work without the other well i would just say the high level and i've got it sorry i've got a hard stop at nine thirty this is super helpful i mean this is really really helpful sudanshu and i think that if you guys can kind of figure out how to chris knows how to repeat these decks but maybe you know no no i'm going to simplify and like again like that was my goal for like validating some of these things with you is that if for norwood like i want to present like a very clear ask and very clear what needs to be true from like other fundraising standpoint what i'm gonna i'm gonna push for pretty hard not that i have any leverage in any of this right it's just that if we do this i would really like that there's a commitment to at least try one bond or mill campaign and be forty nine in the next like three cycles because i still think that if you get that it just solves a lot of problems unless you guys say to me you know how to raise five to ten million dollars for a single school philanthropy outside of colorado springs because this is basically what we're doing with the healthcare school right now where we're saying if bloomberg comes in at five to ten we can kind of do whatever we want if bloomberg doesn't come in we have to do a completely different plan with tracy like it's not even the same school and i think for us we just need to know from kind of your side zach right now my answer to that question is no because like right now i only know dsst to be able to pull this off yeah exactly and dsst has been around for so many years to be able to do it i don't have any other parallels or even my conversations with anshuts and like all the other people who have give to dsst i don't know if they have enough then i would like to frame this almost as we have to take we have to yeah so that's why i was like i wanted to and i need to double check this assumption with lydia again so that then i can frame it as like what needs to be true is bond campaign for this to work yeah and it could be bond or mill to be or mill sorry yeah that terminology like atlas got an extra five percent of their operating funds and yeah that's great because that's that's just my assumption too sudan too is that if we do this we have to have a commitment that csf norwood and legacy are all okay with trying to work with e forty nine in twenty six twenty eight indoor thirty to do something because i just don't i don't have any confidence that ted can raise five million dollars after what you guys put in and what csp puts in after what nora puts in he could get to like a million bucks but if he's got to get to five to seven million dollars in philanthropy i would i would advise him not to do this project because i just don't i couldn't raise that money myself and so i yeah so zach like i think that is the like there are i have taken a list of things to validate to give you an answer to that question in and i'm targeting at least let's say a month for you to get clarity on on this because it requires norwood input it requires like talking to some of the construction like validating construction cost understanding enrollment like all those pieces but again at least like this exercise helped me focus on like hey these are the five things we need to know before we can say a yes or a no to your question i would say through on the construction side you know how frugal brittany is i would call her i would just talk to her about what her assumptions were with that middle school project because she's one of the best when it comes to actually executing these building things like not at your level of financial complexity but like she knows what pink costs and what and she fights truth and nail with everybody over every dollar and so to me if she's like hey the least amount you could build one of these is four hundred fifty i would probably take her out of her word because she knows like even though she had to do some hoops like they just opened that building and i just can't imagine maybe you did a little bit of discount but anyways this is awesome so i'm just gonna tell eric this is what's coming with you guys their conversations with you full capital stack suganchu has the full complexity and roughly you're gonna have they're gonna have to donate land and pre development services and then we're gonna all have to agree to go after a bond ish and it's possible like that's all i'm gonna tell i think that's that's the if that is the base case scenario we are starting with i think this is doable but but if bond doesn't happen is the open question which we need to kind of figure out like in that scenario how do we still work this out yeah that's great okay thank you for all those thanks so helpful awesome thanks zach i will summarize this and then we'll touch base i think in a week after my conversation athletics yeah okay okay appreciate it okay and",

      "audioTranscript": "hey zach how are you good after noon pretty good how are you guys wearing fair play this week yes we went there tuesday to hierarchies how about how's that going pretty good like again had more interest than they had anticipated initially in enrollment so from enrollment standpoint it was pretty good the csi approval that they got was like starting with twenty students maximum go up to thirty six they started with fifty one kids so there's like one district so the interesting thing about park county is like there's one district school but the district pans the driving distance of one and a half hour so there are families that are either homeschooling not going not sending kids to school so those are the families that kind of connect with with hierarchies they were like at least like fifteen to twenty percent of the students that were otherwise homeschooling that have come back into yeah yeah that's great so yeah it was good and then yeah i think this year they because of csp they've also like made sure they are to have a strong launch their staffing more than they initially had in the budget so all those things are helping them in terms of getting the students the only thing is like all the homeschooling kids are coming in far behind especially on the reading fluency and literacy and doing k through eight together has its own challenges so yeah yeah i was just randomly an old friend of mine is thinking about movements to salida and c school back then i was telling her about hierarchies because the charter the full charter approval and some of these small towns like we're kind of going to experience this with rebecca and grand junction can be tough because even if you're coming with one hundred or two hundred kids that's such a big percentage of the district but i was telling her that there's probably some number of like a macro micro school that if you get to it's big enough that you can afford to do it and it's not scary enough for the district that you can maybe get approval yeah the interesting thing and again i don't know the salida we can do more research into that but when we were studying the park county part so like park county in of itself doesn't have lot of like enrollment potential there's one district school but then submit county next to it in the north and then two other counties in the south they have like more than seven eight thousand students so so that is where like hierarchies did the smart thing by getting a charter approved for two hundred plus students i think two hundred fifteen students or something from csi so now like the can they afford transportation to be able to get all those kids no so so they so they basically are going to do like four different micro sites at four different location because again driving distance is the big factor for families so that's how they're thinking about so two other microsite more closer to summit counties how they're thinking okay so they'll have four micro micro sites yeah so four sites with like fifty students fourteen to fifty students so that they can get to like two hundred across the chart yeah yeah cool zach after our last conversation i kind of like ran some numbers did some math and then as we had discussed like put together like the the users and then for this call wanted to like brainstorm the sources side with you and then also like get your thoughts on like framing for norwood framing for like rest of the funders of like how to get this done so we can spend little sometime on that as well let me show so just a quick high level i think so i met with ted just to kind of get his appetite because obviously we need a leader we're going to move faster and then i think what we both talked about what's clear is that it's going to have to be the perch around site it can't be not the nord yeah there's nothing out there so he drove around on we had our check in on tuesday and i have been telling him freestyle just because i you know it's still early enough that it's all it kind of all feels conceptual and then i think after our call last friday which is great obviously like what am i doing going here we can we can't plan on a brand new ten million dollar school or ten dollar school being open in eighteen months on the development that has no roads right there are no roads there right now that's probably not going to you know fly so he drove up to percheron and they're much more it's still very new but there's homes actually there there's roads there the development i think norwood has gotten all of the development plan approved so the plan i think is like set and now they're building it and i just think for this first potential pilot site that's what i'm thinking so i reached out to eric schofield just to say hey can we get together because eric had reached out when you guys were down ironically to be like hey how about a hillsdale school right and i was like hey how about something else like right so i'm meeting with him on tuesday just to kind of get a sense to tell him just to say like this is all really big but can you work with chris to kind of give us a sense of is this at all possible that you're ready to go in mainland by the summer and the latest case right to where we can actually start building something in the next year or two just to know with them that we're not off by like one to three years of their development cycle so if i'm going to start having that conversation with eric at like a lower level and then i know you and lydia are going to be meeting with chris at some point this month yeah but my hope is this month that we can first confirm from that m are they even within like a standard deviation of being ready to do something of this magnitude to call a shot to donate land to do a charter to pick a fellow like that we have now or are we still kind of future casting and we've got to slow this all down and right away ted and i right we were like if nora doesn't do this she got you ted can't go to d forty nine it's just not possible because there's no there's no buildings up there and so we could get him a charter but like the only deal that he could get is a high mark deal and i don't think anybody wants that and so i think that that's where i just realized after last week from our position right like we like if norwood does something our fellow named ted knight can do something and d forty nine and he's been building towards that obviously he's you know he's written the first you know one hundred of the one hundred twenty five page application he's talked to the superintendent and then everybody but i think after our conversation last friday and when i was talking to him and we both were like you know it's not going to do that or you're not interested right because you look at and you're like this is a bad capital stack right then we've got immediately find him a different place to go because there's no facility option in d forty nine that works with that many kids with that like sixty percent not free and reduced lunch population it's just not built out and so i think that that's what we're trying to figure out in the next couple months is like is this norwood csf thing a real possibility and if not we got to pivot like really quick with him to go somewhere else yeah so no that's that's something again when i was running this i had the same conclusion so i think we are pretty aligned there the second just the clarifying question so when you say novard like if this is a possibility and if we can do something is it about the site that you had shown me or is it about the other side that already has the perch around site so does norwood have presence there and like can they donate land there so that's their other development it's just like it's one mile north okay so that also is is norwood so it will be the similar blueprint like either here or not okay it's in normal development that's actually being that actually has homes in it right okay i think you might only have fifty or one hundred homes right but it's it's approved they're building it it's come and i think when the marzano school got approved to got you i think they penciled in that they were going to buy that school site from norwood and you should i if you don't have it but percheron's p e r c h e r o n if you don't have that somewhere in email i can send you the developer i have the blank page development plan it it looks essentially like freestyle it's just a mile north and it's probably a year to three years ahead of the freestyle development got it and it has a designated like roughly twenty acre site that's going to be for school and i my gut would be is if we don't step in one of two things is going to happen either marzano or an existing charter school is going to buy it from them or eric and chris are going to run out and find a hill scale classical school and try to recruit them to come to that site that's what i would guess like if you look at me like look this all sounded great but this is just this is nuts there's no way of doing this money we looked at is that this is not we don't want to be there i just think one of the approved charters of the forty nine will buy it or eric and chris will go out and use it as bait to recruit bill scale classical network to come and then in that case i mean i do think there's a domino chain that if they were to do that and i think it's just like a possibility that then they would just be like yeah let's just copy paste this yeah yeah it's just they're all still classical it's a whole network comes yeah and for the next twenty years every time they open up development they bring hillsdale school to it yeah zach a question on so i think when we were in idaho mark had shared that one of the reasons why these new developments are partnering with charter schools versus district is that like district is moving slow it has been difficult to pass the bond and charters are getting at least some portion of their own capital and like some donation from the developer is at least getting them school which can help them sell homes i'm just curious like how's that how's that dynamics in d forty nine is there a bond yeah i mean that's where i just really appreciated yeah i don't know trip i thought it was going to be good but i think it's exact i mean it's not perfect overlay but it's almost the same this issue like d forty nine is not good like when we talk to the lance and i talk to the superintendent and we were just like hey are you thinking about a bond or a bill yeah and they're like no that's never going to happen we tried a twenty three and we got crushed and we were like well twenty three was not a good time to go and they were just like i don't know so they don't have enough money to match the growth of nullwood so they're going to be behind it but then i think without you guys at the table showing norwood how to do this in a different way norwood would either just i mean honestly they would just sell the land to marzano and be like they have to deliver however they're doing it with highmark right and they would probably have somehow that if you don't deliver a school i don't know they can rebuy it going i don't know how developers do that but nobody norwood doesn't have the money to build the schools and the district doesn't have the money to build those goals and i think that that's certainly the case i mean i think that miners you being at the table or us being at the table nor would just have sold these pieces to these classical schools they would have bootstrapped it but that bootstrap would have come at the cost of basically any low income kid amenities that you need to transportation outreach whatever and it would just be is probably rich as possible to match the brand new development that that's what i would guess because i think that that's what we saw with marzano's charter presentation is i'm guessing kymark can step in and tell everybody it's super doable and then the weight of that all just goes to the marzano folks and if they deliver they deliver it if not marziana owns the land and sells it to somebody else yeah okay i'm starting with the thesis that percheron site has development requires a school either it can be a marzano school or xyz classical school or hillsdale yeah or but there is a need and like we want to compete to make sure or we want to present a plan which is in partnership with norwood like is more doable than other options so that we can have the high chance yeah okay yeah and there's not actually what's the nice thing about the percheron side is when you go like one mile i don't know it's like maybe it's three miles it's not that far but once you go like one standard deviation north there's no charter school out there down by freestyle there's a school called rocky mountain classical that's already full on the west side of it there's so much growth coming that there could easily be another one down there but the nice thing about percheron is the closest one is being in academy and that was built for the danny lewis development and that's completely full so whoever gets to percheron and i think this is probably why marzano was so bullish or high mark was bullish with them as whoever gets the percheron first will have kids yeah would be my guest so last question on this like do we know where is marzano on all this right now like are they moving quickly we talked to them i mean i think the good thing is we got to we got to norwood soon enough that they have not they've not offered made committed to them yet yeah and then eric's email last week made it sound like an i'll confirm this on tuesday just some very basic things but it made it sound like they're they would even be more interested in just finding like a hillsdale school than just selling to marzano i picked up a vibe that they didn't love the marzano approach for whatever reason i don't know if it's because they want something so much more conservative without seeing a lot of things or not but yeah so those are the kind of three players i think that that's enough like for the thesis to kind of work out the hypothesis right that yeah if we move quickly we might be able to yeah we still have a chance okay okay this is super helpful context i think my question on enrollment i mean we'll have to dig more deep with brian on this but at least like knowing that it's not the empty side like gives me more more comfort and then the second question i had in my need to validate list was around the district bond which also you answered so and what i would say is bryce what is i think important that you can't write it into the model right because it's not you can't bank on it but i think there's an assumption that i have which is to make all of this just way less stressful for everybody right is if the ideal case would be is if we could do the pilot with ted affair and try to convince chris that like if we do this and they worked with you to create a more complex capital stack we shouldn't take a couple bites at the apple with that bond campaign and if it's not twenty six we should do it in twenty eight with the presidential it would be so ridiculous for that district to not go in twenty eight unless the economy is in like a depression and i think that that's where if you can somehow do it without the bond but have something that if the bond hits everybody gets made whole i don't know how you guys do that or how the complexity of that all shakes out but that's what i think everybody should do because that could be a huge win for csf norwood and the district and obviously the school because the school is going to need more like they're going to need at least two of these twenty twenty five million dollar buildings to be able to fit well three yeah ok so the bond part anyway for the phase one i had not included in any scenario and then for phase two it was one of the options that i had but we can we can talk through that as we get into this let me can you give me access to ok so zach i started with one like long term affordability because if it doesn't work in the long term like it will be i mean we can put lot of effort fixing it in the short term but then it will get stuck at some point so i started with that to say that ok across the two phases to serve twelve hundred students what would be the maximum cost that school can afford based on average costing and then what are the levels that we then need to pull to get it to schools affordability range either on the financing side or on the partnership side or other things but like at least this helped me lay out of like what is the need or like what is the gap that we need to figure out with different levers again fourteen thousand is not a d forty nine today revenue it is lower than that but again looking at like twenty thirty and beyond when it will be at full scale so fields conservative but still so this basically looking at that if school spends twelve percent of the revenue on facilities dead service the total cost project cost that they can afford like total debt is around twenty six million but around total project cost taking out all the financing other expenses is around twenty five million dollars is is what school can afford on its own now this was just again the starting point so like let's say if school goes out to finance this debt they can get twenty five million now this was very top down of like ok school spends twelve percent this is what they can do now then i did the bottoms up calculation i took out like all the knowledge i had about gem prep elevate all the other idaho schools to look at like what is their kind of square foot for like total number of students and like did all the math and understanding there i think for them it is between seventy to eighty five square foot per student is the building that they develop elevate is higher elevate is around one hundred ten because they have this technical building backside so they are around one hundred one hundred twenty but gem was more around eighty seventy to eighty five kind of use that as the base here for us for ted again we can change these numbers debate that but for the purpose of this exercise i think it was around sixty thousand square foot in phase one and then around forty forty five thousand dollars square foot in the phase two development was seven hundred and five hundred students again this is for discussion so we can change these numbers as we talk but this was my base case which i had developed so again this was the hard and soft cost not the other contingency and like other things but like this is what i have looked at again idaho projects are below that i think elevate was around two hundred eighty gm was around two hundred ninety so those were the things that we had but this is something that i need to validate and like we need to do more work on but based on something like this yeah i was going to say the good test case and that i've been thinking about as atlas just built their middle school the best grant right and that middle school project was somewhere around forty forty five thousand square feet yeah and that cost twenty five million dollars so i think and they already owned the land pretty frugal i mean you've now brittany right so i've just been using my head that you're probably going to get lucky in colorado springs to be at five hundred dollars a square foot in construction after you factor in the land costs factoring the land cost ok the only thing which happens with best grant like if you have received the best grant and you are getting the reimbursement i think and this was the thing that i faced in california a lot was like you have to go through if you're getting a federal or like a best kind of grant you have to go through like prevailing wage which increases the project budget by almost thirty percent it was around thirty five percent in california so that was another thing which we have to kind of figure out of like i mean thirty percent is a big number on five hundred like it will be around one hundred fifty dollars so i think that is like if we are not relying on a best kind of grand and if we can go directly that is where we can save on overall cost so instead of like twenty five million and i think the only thing that we talked about this last time is like and i fully agree with that could be twenty thirty percent just you have to do it because of how you have to do it invest yeah there's a norm quality preference taste tax but then also balance that out you could ignore what lights nice stuff and like that will also you just have that in the back of your mind that like you know norwood will want my assumption is normal to want these things to look at least ten percent nicer than what you know the charter would just be like we're totally fine it's a box it passes it has classrooms and passes like you know right inspections but this one i'm pretty sure test that as you talk with them about just there because chris is doing a lot with the palmer project right now sudan he took a whole like team he paid for like thirty people from colorado springs to go out to visit like historical beautiful buildings and on the east coast last year ahead of the palmer thing and like he's a part of that in that high school they have slated for two hundred million dollars and so it's not he's not going to want that on a charter but you'll just you'll want to feel that out i don't know but you'll want to feel that out because they're not always costco conservative type developer that's like you know very efficient they are very efficient but sometimes they like nice things yeah no which is which again depending on how big the hole is like we'll have to manage their expectation as well so that's why like this exercise was like okay if you want to do your quality like put it like make it closer to seven hundred and let's see what the hole is and then and then like if you want to save like this is what we typically look at so holes are going to be big i mean i like this because i'm like basically this even if it's this right they're going to be in the ballpark of forty to fifty million dollars right like even if like copy those and then you know i know you didn't get to it yet but like then it's going to be at least twice the the first math shows you they can afford at twenty five million right so so then then like the phase two i basically increased the price because it always does so so this was the phase two so now again we need to pressure test this assumption there is a trade off here clear trade off here around quality amenities all the things that we want to figure out but let's start with this number and we can keep playing with this number to come back to what we want so looking at that i kind of built the sources and users here for phase one and phase two so phase one again this is more of the predef cost of like initially working getting the site all those things and then this was just the land cost and other things that i have just named again these are the numbers to be tested but this number is basically donations of whatever price this gets to it will get adjusted here but then this was the construction cost and then some financing costs so it was around twenty six million dollars for phase one and then for the phase two like you in three years if you do that like the total cost is somewhere around forty million dollars is what what we have right now now again it's showing forty three million dollars because it it doesn't it includes the land and everything so that will be donated but let's say i think five million was the total indonesia okay so this was the affordability and this is where the project cost is landing across two faces i think the whole right now is around seventeen million dollars right so let's say five million is is donated there is still like a twelve million dollar gap that we need to figure out if if this works so so now then i again and then what are the levers that we have like there is some financing levers that we can pull but i think based on what i understand i think either either the fundraising bond or school increasing the spend on facilities are the three biggest drivers here financing might solve for like the short term but not for the long term for now so i think those were the three three levers that we had so the first lever which is more on ted's control is can they increase the spend instead of twelve percent to let's say fourteen on facilities for for comparison like idaho spends around fifteen sixteen to seventeen percent is what this kind because their ppr is also like much lower around nine thousand five hundred dollars is their property you've been selling fellows to do twenty just because we we can't fix twenty is everything zach like it will also might include the operating regular operating cost which is around four to five percent so if i just do the debt service part of it should be fourteen to fifteen percent so if we increase that let's say fifteen percent is what we do that so it it brings it reduces the need by around six million dollars overall so the the whole right now is around six point five million dollars you're right this is the i mean you this is the entire colorado spring story of charter schools in a nutshell right which is this is why we've never had any good equitable schools and we haven't even had any yeah if if like the school is spending fifty to fifteen percent of the revenue like it's it's coming at a cost of your program end of the day so what we don't exist no i'm saying they don't oh they don't exist yeah yeah yeah this is why none of we have no there's only one atlas in the whole city is because we didn't do this we went out and raised a bunch of money and we took out a tremendous amount of debt and then we passed the mill in a bond and then that's why now atlas exists and then the vanguard tca all the classical schools they started in the worst ugliest buildings where they like leased trailers and like thirty years later they finally you know had a modest building and so i think that that's that because in a nutshell in colorado springs you can't you know no schools ever raised five million dollars in plants b not one and no schools ever raised twelve million dollars in flint yeah so again like that is something that we are trying to fix but again there's no like one source that will fill everything so i'm i was just trying to see like okay and again if the bond or mill comes like lot of this will get solved like if if the school gets ten million even ten million dollars allocation from the bond like it significantly solves the need but i was like okay in the other scenario where like the bond is not the plug what do we do here so so that was that is what was trying to solve and i think that that right like i think that's what i would say right is like and and that assumes that you can really hold the three to four hundred a square foot what i don't know right which you'll have to tell me because you're also used to working in either richer markets or bigger state markets that have like bigger state funding per school maybe for grants foundations that are jcaf or growth funds or whatever so like that's the that's the thing zach like so jcaf didn't solve for the affordability for any of these schools like they only did the short term like whatever they did with building hope was only solving for the short term affordability problem not the long term affordability problem they didn't put they didn't put any equity in the building for any of the schools what is the way that idaho is solving for it so idaho basically is like their total project cost is around fifteen sixteen million dollars for their six hundred five to six hundred student schools right and and how they are doing it is basically yeah so that is the another level that i wanted to talk about which can solve is on the financing side is this right right now assuming like what's the current market rate for a typical cdfi loan now if the school gets eligible for moral obligation if there is some capital stack where we can leverage norwood's balance sheet or some kind of guarantee this is another level like instead of again one of the schools here just three months back got a loan for five point one percent so so if you do that what is that yeah so if i if i reduce it to let's say five percent and maturity on thirty five years because this is typically like what you can get if you have moral obligation you are in surplus here like so this if you go to fifteen percent and you get five nine bucks yeah if you go to fifteen percent yeah how did you get that how do you get that number this this number is basically yeah so this again schools are still getting this number for their long term financing so it's not completely like a concept that i'm talking about crown point academy just got five point one percent on their long term issue thirty five years because they had like they had an operating history and and certain financial position they applied for credit rating and they got the moral obligation state credit enhancement which basically reduced eric duran from from am i blanking short on the name we don't want to work with them but da davidson da davidson so he told me that he got a deal for one of the big charter school more classical kind at four point seven five percent so again these are not the concept numbers like we can get there and and kind of make it to some affordability this is another level that we can we need to figure out like we want to make sure that ted is hitting those financial targets to in five years to be able to qualify for this and then does the one that we went through that was idaho classical when they because they they needed that that phase two construction to start almost like immediately right catch up to their like like how how are how are they solving that where it's so again they're going for a short term financing now and like that is something that we will be discussing with norwood so short term financing how it works in idaho is that they get sixty five percent of the total cost as loan from the bank banks bank loans there are somewhere around five to five point five percent right now in in idaho same as here and then like basically over last five to seven years jcaf bloom and all the charter schools have made an effort and have created a revolving loan fund with idaho state so they provide two and a half million dollars at zero percent interest rate ecosystem that takes time to build with all these tools right that you help people set up i think one of the things just for today is you know i i understand no so again like again all those revolving loan funds equivalent of that and other things we can we can figure out and we can get to make it work in the short term i i'm not too worried about i think when you combine like right the norwood piece your guys's piece the the fast construction timeline right because maybe if all like if you and lydia and norwood and his head and us and lance sit down with peter at b forty ninth maybe there's some world where they allow us to get approved and you know april instead of june but i think for today i just wanted to get at a high level do you think it's possible to do this complex of a deal not not ever i think it's possible for sure ever but like where like kids would actually be walking into a new building in twenty months yeah none of this is yeah so i think i think it is possible the only three big variables that i wanted to get an understanding from you which we talked about was not from you like we have to do little more work to to for me to firmly give you that answer is the the construction cost like what i've assumed like if it is like two and a half times or two times twice of this i don't think this will work so so getting clarity on like hey am i working with the right numbers is forty million dollar building is what we are talking about for the school or are we talking about eighty billion dollar today so so that what would you make for three hundred fifty and the four hundred so i would say in in aurora the project that dsst or ast aurora science and technology is working on the total project cost there for eleven hundred students is fifty five million dollars okay so but again it's a it's a district building and they are going through they're building it to the standards of a new builder now it's a new build fresh like completely new build in a new upcoming development there yeah aurora highline so somewhere in the ballpark forty to fifty million but but their square footage would at least be one hundred twenty square foot per student yeah because it's it's it's a district like district is building that and owning is this a fair way to say this because i think there's a simple thing that i want to say to eric next week and also ted but if norwood were to donate the land and basically a million dollars worth of pre development services to be all in and let's say five million csf and legacy could match that five million from somebody else or another five million of grants and if we did that there's a project here and if we did that we could even try to get some of that money back in some complex way down the road if there's a bond pass is that a fair sentence yeah this is the the plug that five million dollars we have to fill if considering school is yeah and if we don't get a bond if we got a bond i would be hoping we get a lot more than six million dollars but if we don't get a bond that number we have to raise in blank yeah that's true yeah that's the to have any chance of making this even close to possible that sounds that's about right or does that is that include also the five percent is that five point eight yeah no five dollars you wrote into the first tab sorry so can you repeat that if you go back to that other tab where you put in an extra five million dollars of philanthropy in phase two yeah the affordability tab where you with that five million dollars right there this is basically the the land the land and norwood norwood basically land and and predef whatever they are going to put in this okay so that that assumes that we need that and then if we got a bond or well what happens if you if that number so if you assume norma gives the land and the pre development work at five and then you raise another five million dollars just so then school so then school will will have to will not have to spend fourteen percent of their revenue on facility only twelve you don't need five million from norwood five million from grant and five billion dollars from bonds you just need a total of about eight to ten million yeah this this is my gap that i'm solving for okay all right so total gap that i'm solving for so like the three livers that i was trying to pull is like how much norwood can give how much school can increase the annual spend so that they can raise more debt or bond was it my third big driver i think the fourth other driver is just the capital stack innovation which increase decreases the interest rate and brings this number down to let's say seven eight million dollars versus eleven yeah so those are the four those are the four things that we need to figure out yeah roughly it's a roughly fifty million dollars project that if we get five from norwood and five from somewhere else and do innovative things we have a chance of doing this no so the total project cost is around forty three to forty five million dollars let's let's anchor on forty five million dollars and this forty and school can basically afford around twenty five million dollars sorry you already adjusted the interest rate up top yeah that's with the five percent yeah so overall like this is the gap that exists now this can be solved like we'll have to pull all the other levers that we have is let me actually change this to let's say bond other philanthropy yeah school increase cool i don't see a world if we can't get a waste of five norwood's not going to put in five million if we can't match it with five million of something so i think that's where that has to be five because they won't do it if no one's going to match it yeah and then school increasing either school increases something or we decrease the interest rate here yeah you make that two percent what is what do we get to right off the bat so where are we yeah so we're in the ballpark and then the better rate would not get yeah and the better rate will knock it down further so yeah if we okay that's helpful because then i'm just going to kind of say like it's yeah we need five but if norwood what happens to donchu if norwood's able to get a higher appraisal of the land does that help if the land is artificially appraised higher does that help much or not really not really it's just that yeah we can we can probably say a few basis points here because the equity contribution is more yeah not significant yeah yeah okay because then then that is yeah yeah that is because right now what what i'm assuming here is like everything that is donated so whatever is the increase there is basically cancelling of indonesia so you don't have any cash from norwood in this model right this one donated services yeah this one no no other cash yeah but that five million is in cash right no this basically is total of this will just cut this off and i don't know if they do that or have the crap but if they did all the pre development and site work and donated the land and never gave you a dollar of cash yeah this is this is what this is what it assumes there's no cash on top of what these three things got it okay when you you've done a ton of these what how do you score how possible this is to all pull off in twenty months the financing side of this can be pulled i think like the biggest again let me go back to this one this is the biggest one which i'm not sure of oh sorry yeah this one yeah and that we need to like norwood i don't we'll find out you guys don't i think so this basically means the land donation so this is not additional but they have to do it or there's no project yeah yeah that that that is that is a given like yeah that has to be done otherwise there's no cons norwood land yeah okay so that was an assumption that has to get checked yeah yeah and and this is basically in schools control of how they come out sudashir how much time do you do what we have to find the second five million like we have to know norwood's five million soon now no we no we can we can go ahead with the first we can potentially go ahead with our phase one the phase one if if if we have all this in place i think the biggest challenge would be to make the short term affordability work and that is where our our grant funding and csp will basically solve for it yeah yeah okay and then would you have a year two years three years so again like that is that is that is a piece which i wanted to like again that would be a ted question right now my thinking this was something which i had in like if you are doing like a seven hundred student phase one and five hundred student phase two this is this is what i had in idaho basically built their buildings so they could have the full k eight phase one covered the full case so so jim actually tried both options they did the full build in one go they tried breaking it down i think for them like because they start with like k through two and five six or like six seven great and then build it out for them like space was space planning didn't work out well so they go for the whole thing together what would you recommend like if ted could film way more kids sooner should he do that or should he slow it down so you have time to raise the capital stack for phase two i would say that would be the like i mean it will take that much time for the second phase putting together the capital stack plus like plus the biggest biggest unknown here is that getting the financing for this without any enrollment data there is always an option like if if he's hitting the enrollment target my guess is that it will be easier for any lender to even increase their loan to value there which increase decreases the fundraising need so right now like i have assumed it like on the lower side because i know without any enrollment data like most of the lenders would be like hey we cannot go up above x percent loan to value so okay that's great yeah i mean to be honest to be really honest to don't you i mean you're in charge of the enrollment growth plan for ted because whatever you tell us to do we're going to do because we both know books i didn't i know that we just it's all building dependent and so like you don't have to pick that that was my question zach which which and again i i've written it in my notes of like things to validate is the enrollment ramp up and its validity like i can anything can look good in on excel and like we can build any number here my my bigger question is that like i i don't know enough about this development to say that like can a startup school in roll three hundred fifty students in year one i think that doesn't make me nervous because there were other models where we basically had to get to all twelve hundred kids by year five or something and you know in my head i was like i wasn't sure if you got to get to the whole enrollment to be able to afford any of this and so you want to raise the twelve hundred that made me kind of sick to my stomach i think that it like this is this is not this is basically what marc arzano is proposing and they're a charter application that they get to about six hundred by year by twenty twenty nine i think that that's got to be doable because i think that that's not doable this whole thing is going to crumble and i think we're we're different we're going to make ted have to find money for some transportation so like it's we're forcing him to put a meaningful number of his budget in transportation so that he can until the development is fully built out he can run buses in competition with all of you know d forty nine and even d twenty if he's good so i think that that's really doable i would prefer right whatever the slowest growth plan that you think is works that's what i would prefer because i don't know i don't like these like we're going to get a thousand kids within three years so i think you if you tell me whatever the ideal growth plan is i'm just going to ask you is that is that the slowest that we can do and if you say yes then i'm just going to work with ted and we're going to backwards plan from that growth plan yeah so zach like again without knowing like the school model or or the structure again i can assume based on what i know but my guess is that this this portion so csp is i i've assumed around one point eight million and then my guess is and based on what we have typically seen this will require another two to three million dollars just the operating total or per year oh but total yeah yeah because because you are going in a permanent facility yeah so there will be like some operating gap like because in your initial years you are spending significantly higher so this has to this has to get covered through some startup funding and that is where so this number and this number like we'll have to whoever we are going to for fundraising we'll have to present the whole package because one doesn't work without the other well i would just say the high level and i've got it sorry i've got a hard stop at nine thirty this is super helpful i mean this is really really helpful sudanshu and i think that if you guys can kind of figure out how to chris knows how to repeat these decks but maybe you know no no i'm going to simplify and like again like that was my goal for like validating some of these things with you is that if for norwood like i want to present like a very clear ask and very clear what needs to be true from like other fundraising standpoint what i'm gonna i'm gonna push for pretty hard not that i have any leverage in any of this right it's just that if we do this i would really like that there's a commitment to at least try one bond or mill campaign and be forty nine in the next like three cycles because i still think that if you get that it just solves a lot of problems unless you guys say to me you know how to raise five to ten million dollars for a single school philanthropy outside of colorado springs because this is basically what we're doing with the healthcare school right now where we're saying if bloomberg comes in at five to ten we can kind of do whatever we want if bloomberg doesn't come in we have to do a completely different plan with tracy like it's not even the same school and i think for us we just need to know from kind of your side zach right now my answer to that question is no because like right now i only know dsst to be able to pull this off yeah exactly and dsst has been around for so many years to be able to do it i don't have any other parallels or even my conversations with anshuts and like all the other people who have give to dsst i don't know if they have enough then i would like to frame this almost as we have to take we have to yeah so that's why i was like i wanted to and i need to double check this assumption with lydia again so that then i can frame it as like what needs to be true is bond campaign for this to work yeah and it could be bond or mill to be or mill sorry yeah that terminology like atlas got an extra five percent of their operating funds and yeah that's great because that's that's just my assumption too sudan too is that if we do this we have to have a commitment that csf norwood and legacy are all okay with trying to work with e forty nine in twenty six twenty eight indoor thirty to do something because i just don't i don't have any confidence that ted can raise five million dollars after what you guys put in and what csp puts in after what nora puts in he could get to like a million bucks but if he's got to get to five to seven million dollars in philanthropy i would i would advise him not to do this project because i just don't i couldn't raise that money myself and so i yeah so zach like i think that is the like there are i have taken a list of things to validate to give you an answer to that question in and i'm targeting at least let's say a month for you to get clarity on on this because it requires norwood input it requires like talking to some of the construction like validating construction cost understanding enrollment like all those pieces but again at least like this exercise helped me focus on like hey these are the five things we need to know before we can say a yes or a no to your question i would say through on the construction side you know how frugal brittany is i would call her i would just talk to her about what her assumptions were with that middle school project because she's one of the best when it comes to actually executing these building things like not at your level of financial complexity but like she knows what pink costs and what and she fights truth and nail with everybody over every dollar and so to me if she's like hey the least amount you could build one of these is four hundred fifty i would probably take her out of her word because she knows like even though she had to do some hoops like they just opened that building and i just can't imagine maybe you did a little bit of discount but anyways this is awesome so i'm just gonna tell eric this is what's coming with you guys their conversations with you full capital stack suganchu has the full complexity and roughly you're gonna have they're gonna have to donate land and pre development services and then we're gonna all have to agree to go after a bond ish and it's possible like that's all i'm gonna tell i think that's that's the if that is the base case scenario we are starting with i think this is doable but but if bond doesn't happen is the open question which we need to kind of figure out like in that scenario how do we still work this out yeah that's great okay thank you for all those thanks so helpful awesome thanks zach i will summarize this and then we'll touch base i think in a week after my conversation athletics yeah okay okay appreciate it okay and three thirty",

        "audioTranscript": "hey zach how are you good after noon pretty good how are you guys wearing fair play this week yes we went there tuesday to hierarchies how about how's that going pretty good like again had more interest than they had anticipated initially in enrollment so from enrollment standpoint it was pretty good the csi approval that they got was like starting with twenty students maximum go up to thirty six they started with fifty one kids so there's like one district so the interesting thing about park county is like there's one district school but the district pans the driving distance of one and a half hour so there are families that are either homeschooling not going not sending kids to school so those are the families that kind of connect with with hierarchies they were like at least like fifteen to twenty percent of the students that were otherwise homeschooling that have come back into yeah yeah that's great so yeah it was good and then yeah i think this year they because of csp they've also like made sure they are to have a strong launch their staffing more than they initially had in the budget so all those things are helping them in terms of getting the students the only thing is like all the homeschooling kids are coming in far behind especially on the reading fluency and literacy and doing k through eight together has its own challenges so yeah yeah i was just randomly an old friend of mine is thinking about movements to salida and c school back then i was telling her about hierarchies because the charter the full charter approval and some of these small towns like we're kind of going to experience this with rebecca and grand junction can be tough because even if you're coming with one hundred or two hundred kids that's such a big percentage of the district but i was telling her that there's probably some number of like a macro micro school that if you get to it's big enough that you can afford to do it and it's not scary enough for the district that you can maybe get approval yeah the interesting thing and again i don't know the salida we can do more research into that but when we were studying the park county part so like park county in of itself doesn't have lot of like enrollment potential there's one district school but then submit county next to it in the north and then two other counties in the south they have like more than seven eight thousand students so so that is where like hierarchies did the smart thing by getting a charter approved for two hundred plus students i think two hundred fifteen students or something from csi so now like the can they afford transportation to be able to get all those kids no so so they so they basically are going to do like four different micro sites at four different location because again driving distance is the big factor for families so that's how they're thinking about so two other microsite more closer to summit counties how they're thinking okay so they'll have four micro micro sites yeah so four sites with like fifty students fourteen to fifty students so that they can get to like two hundred across the chart yeah yeah cool zach after our last conversation i kind of like ran some numbers did some math and then as we had discussed like put together like the the users and then for this call wanted to like brainstorm the sources side with you and then also like get your thoughts on like framing for norwood framing for like rest of the funders of like how to get this done so we can spend little sometime on that as well let me show so just a quick high level i think so i met with ted just to kind of get his appetite because obviously we need a leader we're going to move faster and then i think what we both talked about what's clear is that it's going to have to be the perch around site it can't be not the nord yeah there's nothing out there so he drove around on we had our check in on tuesday and i have been telling him freestyle just because i you know it's still early enough that it's all it kind of all feels conceptual and then i think after our call last friday which is great obviously like what am i doing going here we can we can't plan on a brand new ten million dollar school or ten dollar school being open in eighteen months on the development that has no roads right there are no roads there right now that's probably not going to you know fly so he drove up to percheron and they're much more it's still very new but there's homes actually there there's roads there the development i think norwood has gotten all of the development plan approved so the plan i think is like set and now they're building it and i just think for this first potential pilot site that's what i'm thinking so i reached out to eric schofield just to say hey can we get together because eric had reached out when you guys were down ironically to be like hey how about a hillsdale school right and i was like hey how about something else like right so i'm meeting with him on tuesday just to kind of get a sense to tell him just to say like this is all really big but can you work with chris to kind of give us a sense of is this at all possible that you're ready to go in mainland by the summer and the latest case right to where we can actually start building something in the next year or two just to know with them that we're not off by like one to three years of their development cycle so if i'm going to start having that conversation with eric at like a lower level and then i know you and lydia are going to be meeting with chris at some point this month yeah but my hope is this month that we can first confirm from that m are they even within like a standard deviation of being ready to do something of this magnitude to call a shot to donate land to do a charter to pick a fellow like that we have now or are we still kind of future casting and we've got to slow this all down and right away ted and i right we were like if nora doesn't do this she got you ted can't go to d forty nine it's just not possible because there's no there's no buildings up there and so we could get him a charter but like the only deal that he could get is a high mark deal and i don't think anybody wants that and so i think that that's where i just realized after last week from our position right like we like if norwood does something our fellow named ted knight can do something and d forty nine and he's been building towards that obviously he's you know he's written the first you know one hundred of the one hundred twenty five page application he's talked to the superintendent and then everybody but i think after our conversation last friday and when i was talking to him and we both were like you know it's not going to do that or you're not interested right because you look at and you're like this is a bad capital stack right then we've got immediately find him a different place to go because there's no facility option in d forty nine that works with that many kids with that like sixty percent not free and reduced lunch population it's just not built out and so i think that that's what we're trying to figure out in the next couple months is like is this norwood csf thing a real possibility and if not we got to pivot like really quick with him to go somewhere else yeah so no that's that's something again when i was running this i had the same conclusion so i think we are pretty aligned there the second just the clarifying question so when you say novard like if this is a possibility and if we can do something is it about the site that you had shown me or is it about the other side that already has the perch around site so does norwood have presence there and like can they donate land there so that's their other development it's just like it's one mile north okay so that also is is norwood so it will be the similar blueprint like either here or not okay it's in normal development that's actually being that actually has homes in it right okay i think you might only have fifty or one hundred homes right but it's it's approved they're building it it's come and i think when the marzano school got approved to got you i think they penciled in that they were going to buy that school site from norwood and you should i if you don't have it but percheron's p e r c h e r o n if you don't have that somewhere in email i can send you the developer i have the blank page development plan it it looks essentially like freestyle it's just a mile north and it's probably a year to three years ahead of the freestyle development got it and it has a designated like roughly twenty acre site that's going to be for school and i my gut would be is if we don't step in one of two things is going to happen either marzano or an existing charter school is going to buy it from them or eric and chris are going to run out and find a hill scale classical school and try to recruit them to come to that site that's what i would guess like if you look at me like look this all sounded great but this is just this is nuts there's no way of doing this money we looked at is that this is not we don't want to be there i just think one of the approved charters of the forty nine will buy it or eric and chris will go out and use it as bait to recruit bill scale classical network to come and then in that case i mean i do think there's a domino chain that if they were to do that and i think it's just like a possibility that then they would just be like yeah let's just copy paste this yeah yeah it's just they're all still classical it's a whole network comes yeah and for the next twenty years every time they open up development they bring hillsdale school to it yeah zach a question on so i think when we were in idaho mark had shared that one of the reasons why these new developments are partnering with charter schools versus district is that like district is moving slow it has been difficult to pass the bond and charters are getting at least some portion of their own capital and like some donation from the developer is at least getting them school which can help them sell homes i'm just curious like how's that how's that dynamics in d forty nine is there a bond yeah i mean that's where i just really appreciated yeah i don't know trip i thought it was going to be good but i think it's exact i mean it's not perfect overlay but it's almost the same this issue like d forty nine is not good like when we talk to the lance and i talk to the superintendent and we were just like hey are you thinking about a bond or a bill yeah and they're like no that's never going to happen we tried a twenty three and we got crushed and we were like well twenty three was not a good time to go and they were just like i don't know so they don't have enough money to match the growth of nullwood so they're going to be behind it but then i think without you guys at the table showing norwood how to do this in a different way norwood would either just i mean honestly they would just sell the land to marzano and be like they have to deliver however they're doing it with highmark right and they would probably have somehow that if you don't deliver a school i don't know they can rebuy it going i don't know how developers do that but nobody norwood doesn't have the money to build the schools and the district doesn't have the money to build those goals and i think that that's certainly the case i mean i think that miners you being at the table or us being at the table nor would just have sold these pieces to these classical schools they would have bootstrapped it but that bootstrap would have come at the cost of basically any low income kid amenities that you need to transportation outreach whatever and it would just be is probably rich as possible to match the brand new development that that's what i would guess because i think that that's what we saw with marzano's charter presentation is i'm guessing kymark can step in and tell everybody it's super doable and then the weight of that all just goes to the marzano folks and if they deliver they deliver it if not marziana owns the land and sells it to somebody else yeah okay i'm starting with the thesis that percheron site has development requires a school either it can be a marzano school or xyz classical school or hillsdale yeah or but there is a need and like we want to compete to make sure or we want to present a plan which is in partnership with norwood like is more doable than other options so that we can have the high chance yeah okay yeah and there's not actually what's the nice thing about the percheron side is when you go like one mile i don't know it's like maybe it's three miles it's not that far but once you go like one standard deviation north there's no charter school out there down by freestyle there's a school called rocky mountain classical that's already full on the west side of it there's so much growth coming that there could easily be another one down there but the nice thing about percheron is the closest one is being in academy and that was built for the danny lewis development and that's completely full so whoever gets to percheron and i think this is probably why marzano was so bullish or high mark was bullish with them as whoever gets the percheron first will have kids yeah would be my guest so last question on this like do we know where is marzano on all this right now like are they moving quickly we talked to them i mean i think the good thing is we got to we got to norwood soon enough that they have not they've not offered made committed to them yet yeah and then eric's email last week made it sound like an i'll confirm this on tuesday just some very basic things but it made it sound like they're they would even be more interested in just finding like a hillsdale school than just selling to marzano i picked up a vibe that they didn't love the marzano approach for whatever reason i don't know if it's because they want something so much more conservative without seeing a lot of things or not but yeah so those are the kind of three players i think that that's enough like for the thesis to kind of work out the hypothesis right that yeah if we move quickly we might be able to yeah we still have a chance okay okay this is super helpful context i think my question on enrollment i mean we'll have to dig more deep with brian on this but at least like knowing that it's not the empty side like gives me more more comfort and then the second question i had in my need to validate list was around the district bond which also you answered so and what i would say is bryce what is i think important that you can't write it into the model right because it's not you can't bank on it but i think there's an assumption that i have which is to make all of this just way less stressful for everybody right is if the ideal case would be is if we could do the pilot with ted affair and try to convince chris that like if we do this and they worked with you to create a more complex capital stack we shouldn't take a couple bites at the apple with that bond campaign and if it's not twenty six we should do it in twenty eight with the presidential it would be so ridiculous for that district to not go in twenty eight unless the economy is in like a depression and i think that that's where if you can somehow do it without the bond but have something that if the bond hits everybody gets made whole i don't know how you guys do that or how the complexity of that all shakes out but that's what i think everybody should do because that could be a huge win for csf norwood and the district and obviously the school because the school is going to need more like they're going to need at least two of these twenty twenty five million dollar buildings to be able to fit well three yeah ok so the bond part anyway for the phase one i had not included in any scenario and then for phase two it was one of the options that i had but we can we can talk through that as we get into this let me can you give me access to ok so zach i started with one like long term affordability because if it doesn't work in the long term like it will be i mean we can put lot of effort fixing it in the short term but then it will get stuck at some point so i started with that to say that ok across the two phases to serve twelve hundred students what would be the maximum cost that school can afford based on average costing and then what are the levels that we then need to pull to get it to schools affordability range either on the financing side or on the partnership side or other things but like at least this helped me lay out of like what is the need or like what is the gap that we need to figure out with different levers again fourteen thousand is not a d forty nine today revenue it is lower than that but again looking at like twenty thirty and beyond when it will be at full scale so fields conservative but still so this basically looking at that if school spends twelve percent of the revenue on facilities dead service the total cost project cost that they can afford like total debt is around twenty six million but around total project cost taking out all the financing other expenses is around twenty five million dollars is is what school can afford on its own now this was just again the starting point so like let's say if school goes out to finance this debt they can get twenty five million now this was very top down of like ok school spends twelve percent this is what they can do now then i did the bottoms up calculation i took out like all the knowledge i had about gem prep elevate all the other idaho schools to look at like what is their kind of square foot for like total number of students and like did all the math and understanding there i think for them it is between seventy to eighty five square foot per student is the building that they develop elevate is higher elevate is around one hundred ten because they have this technical building backside so they are around one hundred one hundred twenty but gem was more around eighty seventy to eighty five kind of use that as the base here for us for ted again we can change these numbers debate that but for the purpose of this exercise i think it was around sixty thousand square foot in phase one and then around forty forty five thousand dollars square foot in the phase two development was seven hundred and five hundred students again this is for discussion so we can change these numbers as we talk but this was my base case which i had developed so again this was the hard and soft cost not the other contingency and like other things but like this is what i have looked at again idaho projects are below that i think elevate was around two hundred eighty gm was around two hundred ninety so those were the things that we had but this is something that i need to validate and like we need to do more work on but based on something like this yeah i was going to say the good test case and that i've been thinking about as atlas just built their middle school the best grant right and that middle school project was somewhere around forty forty five thousand square feet yeah and that cost twenty five million dollars so i think and they already owned the land pretty frugal i mean you've now brittany right so i've just been using my head that you're probably going to get lucky in colorado springs to be at five hundred dollars a square foot in construction after you factor in the land costs factoring the land cost ok the only thing which happens with best grant like if you have received the best grant and you are getting the reimbursement i think and this was the thing that i faced in california a lot was like you have to go through if you're getting a federal or like a best kind of grant you have to go through like prevailing wage which increases the project budget by almost thirty percent it was around thirty five percent in california so that was another thing which we have to kind of figure out of like i mean thirty percent is a big number on five hundred like it will be around one hundred fifty dollars so i think that is like if we are not relying on a best kind of grand and if we can go directly that is where we can save on overall cost so instead of like twenty five million and i think the only thing that we talked about this last time is like and i fully agree with that could be twenty thirty percent just you have to do it because of how you have to do it invest yeah there's a norm quality preference taste tax but then also balance that out you could ignore what lights nice stuff and like that will also you just have that in the back of your mind that like you know norwood will want my assumption is normal to want these things to look at least ten percent nicer than what you know the charter would just be like we're totally fine it's a box it passes it has classrooms and passes like you know right inspections but this one i'm pretty sure test that as you talk with them about just there because chris is doing a lot with the palmer project right now sudan he took a whole like team he paid for like thirty people from colorado springs to go out to visit like historical beautiful buildings and on the east coast last year ahead of the palmer thing and like he's a part of that in that high school they have slated for two hundred million dollars and so it's not he's not going to want that on a charter but you'll just you'll want to feel that out i don't know but you'll want to feel that out because they're not always costco conservative type developer that's like you know very efficient they are very efficient but sometimes they like nice things yeah no which is which again depending on how big the hole is like we'll have to manage their expectation as well so that's why like this exercise was like okay if you want to do your quality like put it like make it closer to seven hundred and let's see what the hole is and then and then like if you want to save like this is what we typically look at so holes are going to be big i mean i like this because i'm like basically this even if it's this right they're going to be in the ballpark of forty to fifty million dollars right like even if like copy those and then you know i know you didn't get to it yet but like then it's going to be at least twice the the first math shows you they can afford at twenty five million right so so then then like the phase two i basically increased the price because it always does so so this was the phase two so now again we need to pressure test this assumption there is a trade off here clear trade off here around quality amenities all the things that we want to figure out but let's start with this number and we can keep playing with this number to come back to what we want so looking at that i kind of built the sources and users here for phase one and phase two so phase one again this is more of the predef cost of like initially working getting the site all those things and then this was just the land cost and other things that i have just named again these are the numbers to be tested but this number is basically donations of whatever price this gets to it will get adjusted here but then this was the construction cost and then some financing costs so it was around twenty six million dollars for phase one and then for the phase two like you in three years if you do that like the total cost is somewhere around forty million dollars is what what we have right now now again it's showing forty three million dollars because it it doesn't it includes the land and everything so that will be donated but let's say i think five million was the total indonesia okay so this was the affordability and this is where the project cost is landing across two faces i think the whole right now is around seventeen million dollars right so let's say five million is is donated there is still like a twelve million dollar gap that we need to figure out if if this works so so now then i again and then what are the levers that we have like there is some financing levers that we can pull but i think based on what i understand i think either either the fundraising bond or school increasing the spend on facilities are the three biggest drivers here financing might solve for like the short term but not for the long term for now so i think those were the three three levers that we had so the first lever which is more on ted's control is can they increase the spend instead of twelve percent to let's say fourteen on facilities for for comparison like idaho spends around fifteen sixteen to seventeen percent is what this kind because their ppr is also like much lower around nine thousand five hundred dollars is their property you've been selling fellows to do twenty just because we we can't fix twenty is everything zach like it will also might include the operating regular operating cost which is around four to five percent so if i just do the debt service part of it should be fourteen to fifteen percent so if we increase that let's say fifteen percent is what we do that so it it brings it reduces the need by around six million dollars overall so the the whole right now is around six point five million dollars you're right this is the i mean you this is the entire colorado spring story of charter schools in a nutshell right which is this is why we've never had any good equitable schools and we haven't even had any yeah if if like the school is spending fifty to fifteen percent of the revenue like it's it's coming at a cost of your program end of the day so what we don't exist no i'm saying they don't oh they don't exist yeah yeah yeah this is why none of we have no there's only one atlas in the whole city is because we didn't do this we went out and raised a bunch of money and we took out a tremendous amount of debt and then we passed the mill in a bond and then that's why now atlas exists and then the vanguard tca all the classical schools they started in the worst ugliest buildings where they like leased trailers and like thirty years later they finally you know had a modest building and so i think that that's that because in a nutshell in colorado springs you can't you know no schools ever raised five million dollars in plants b not one and no schools ever raised twelve million dollars in flint yeah so again like that is something that we are trying to fix but again there's no like one source that will fill everything so i'm i was just trying to see like okay and again if the bond or mill comes like lot of this will get solved like if if the school gets ten million even ten million dollars allocation from the bond like it significantly solves the need but i was like okay in the other scenario where like the bond is not the plug what do we do here so so that was that is what was trying to solve and i think that that right like i think that's what i would say right is like and and that assumes that you can really hold the three to four hundred a square foot what i don't know right which you'll have to tell me because you're also used to working in either richer markets or bigger state markets that have like bigger state funding per school maybe for grants foundations that are jcaf or growth funds or whatever so like that's the that's the thing zach like so jcaf didn't solve for the affordability for any of these schools like they only did the short term like whatever they did with building hope was only solving for the short term affordability problem not the long term affordability problem they didn't put they didn't put any equity in the building for any of the schools what is the way that idaho is solving for it so idaho basically is like their total project cost is around fifteen sixteen million dollars for their six hundred five to six hundred student schools right and and how they are doing it is basically yeah so that is the another level that i wanted to talk about which can solve is on the financing side is this right right now assuming like what's the current market rate for a typical cdfi loan now if the school gets eligible for moral obligation if there is some capital stack where we can leverage norwood's balance sheet or some kind of guarantee this is another level like instead of again one of the schools here just three months back got a loan for five point one percent so so if you do that what is that yeah so if i if i reduce it to let's say five percent and maturity on thirty five years because this is typically like what you can get if you have moral obligation you are in surplus here like so this if you go to fifteen percent and you get five nine bucks yeah if you go to fifteen percent yeah how did you get that how do you get that number this this number is basically yeah so this again schools are still getting this number for their long term financing so it's not completely like a concept that i'm talking about crown point academy just got five point one percent on their long term issue thirty five years because they had like they had an operating history and and certain financial position they applied for credit rating and they got the moral obligation state credit enhancement which basically reduced eric duran from from am i blanking short on the name we don't want to work with them but da davidson da davidson so he told me that he got a deal for one of the big charter school more classical kind at four point seven five percent so again these are not the concept numbers like we can get there and and kind of make it to some affordability this is another level that we can we need to figure out like we want to make sure that ted is hitting those financial targets to in five years to be able to qualify for this and then does the one that we went through that was idaho classical when they because they they needed that that phase two construction to start almost like immediately right catch up to their like like how how are how are they solving that where it's so again they're going for a short term financing now and like that is something that we will be discussing with norwood so short term financing how it works in idaho is that they get sixty five percent of the total cost as loan from the bank banks bank loans there are somewhere around five to five point five percent right now in in idaho same as here and then like basically over last five to seven years jcaf bloom and all the charter schools have made an effort and have created a revolving loan fund with idaho state so they provide two and a half million dollars at zero percent interest rate ecosystem that takes time to build with all these tools right that you help people set up i think one of the things just for today is you know i i understand no so again like again all those revolving loan funds equivalent of that and other things we can we can figure out and we can get to make it work in the short term i i'm not too worried about i think when you combine like right the norwood piece your guys's piece the the fast construction timeline right because maybe if all like if you and lydia and norwood and his head and us and lance sit down with peter at b forty ninth maybe there's some world where they allow us to get approved and you know april instead of june but i think for today i just wanted to get at a high level do you think it's possible to do this complex of a deal not not ever i think it's possible for sure ever but like where like kids would actually be walking into a new building in twenty months yeah none of this is yeah so i think i think it is possible the only three big variables that i wanted to get an understanding from you which we talked about was not from you like we have to do little more work to to for me to firmly give you that answer is the the construction cost like what i've assumed like if it is like two and a half times or two times twice of this i don't think this will work so so getting clarity on like hey am i working with the right numbers is forty million dollar building is what we are talking about for the school or are we talking about eighty billion dollar today so so that what would you make for three hundred fifty and the four hundred so i would say in in aurora the project that dsst or ast aurora science and technology is working on the total project cost there for eleven hundred students is fifty five million dollars okay so but again it's a it's a district building and they are going through they're building it to the standards of a new builder now it's a new build fresh like completely new build in a new upcoming development there yeah aurora highline so somewhere in the ballpark forty to fifty million but but their square footage would at least be one hundred twenty square foot per student yeah because it's it's it's a district like district is building that and owning is this a fair way to say this because i think there's a simple thing that i want to say to eric next week and also ted but if norwood were to donate the land and basically a million dollars worth of pre development services to be all in and let's say five million csf and legacy could match that five million from somebody else or another five million of grants and if we did that there's a project here and if we did that we could even try to get some of that money back in some complex way down the road if there's a bond pass is that a fair sentence yeah this is the the plug that five million dollars we have to fill if considering school is yeah and if we don't get a bond if we got a bond i would be hoping we get a lot more than six million dollars but if we don't get a bond that number we have to raise in blank yeah that's true yeah that's the to have any chance of making this even close to possible that sounds that's about right or does that is that include also the five percent is that five point eight yeah no five dollars you wrote into the first tab sorry so can you repeat that if you go back to that other tab where you put in an extra five million dollars of philanthropy in phase two yeah the affordability tab where you with that five million dollars right there this is basically the the land the land and norwood norwood basically land and and predef whatever they are going to put in this okay so that that assumes that we need that and then if we got a bond or well what happens if you if that number so if you assume norma gives the land and the pre development work at five and then you raise another five million dollars just so then school so then school will will have to will not have to spend fourteen percent of their revenue on facility only twelve you don't need five million from norwood five million from grant and five billion dollars from bonds you just need a total of about eight to ten million yeah this this is my gap that i'm solving for okay all right so total gap that i'm solving for so like the three livers that i was trying to pull is like how much norwood can give how much school can increase the annual spend so that they can raise more debt or bond was it my third big driver i think the fourth other driver is just the capital stack innovation which increase decreases the interest rate and brings this number down to let's say seven eight million dollars versus eleven yeah so those are the four those are the four things that we need to figure out yeah roughly it's a roughly fifty million dollars project that if we get five from norwood and five from somewhere else and do innovative things we have a chance of doing this no so the total project cost is around forty three to forty five million dollars let's let's anchor on forty five million dollars and this forty and school can basically afford around twenty five million dollars sorry you already adjusted the interest rate up top yeah that's with the five percent yeah so overall like this is the gap that exists now this can be solved like we'll have to pull all the other levers that we have is let me actually change this to let's say bond other philanthropy yeah school increase cool i don't see a world if we can't get a waste of five norwood's not going to put in five million if we can't match it with five million of something so i think that's where that has to be five because they won't do it if no one's going to match it yeah and then school increasing either school increases something or we decrease the interest rate here yeah you make that two percent what is what do we get to right off the bat so where are we yeah so we're in the ballpark and then the better rate would not get yeah and the better rate will knock it down further so yeah if we okay that's helpful because then i'm just going to kind of say like it's yeah we need five but if norwood what happens to donchu if norwood's able to get a higher appraisal of the land does that help if the land is artificially appraised higher does that help much or not really not really it's just that yeah we can we can probably say a few basis points here because the equity contribution is more yeah not significant yeah yeah okay because then then that is yeah yeah that is because right now what what i'm assuming here is like everything that is donated so whatever is the increase there is basically cancelling of indonesia so you don't have any cash from norwood in this model right this one donated services yeah this one no no other cash yeah but that five million is in cash right no this basically is total of this will just cut this off and i don't know if they do that or have the crap but if they did all the pre development and site work and donated the land and never gave you a dollar of cash yeah this is this is what this is what it assumes there's no cash on top of what these three things got it okay when you you've done a ton of these what how do you score how possible this is to all pull off in twenty months the financing side of this can be pulled i think like the biggest again let me go back to this one this is the biggest one which i'm not sure of oh sorry yeah this one yeah and that we need to like norwood i don't we'll find out you guys don't i think so this basically means the land donation so this is not additional but they have to do it or there's no project yeah yeah that that that is that is a given like yeah that has to be done otherwise there's no cons norwood land yeah okay so that was an assumption that has to get checked yeah yeah and and this is basically in schools control of how they come out sudashir how much time do you do what we have to find the second five million like we have to know norwood's five million soon now no we no we can we can go ahead with the first we can potentially go ahead with our phase one the phase one if if if we have all this in place i think the biggest challenge would be to make the short term affordability work and that is where our our grant funding and csp will basically solve for it yeah yeah okay and then would you have a year two years three years so again like that is that is that is a piece which i wanted to like again that would be a ted question right now my thinking this was something which i had in like if you are doing like a seven hundred student phase one and five hundred student phase two this is this is what i had in idaho basically built their buildings so they could have the full k eight phase one covered the full case so so jim actually tried both options they did the full build in one go they tried breaking it down i think for them like because they start with like k through two and five six or like six seven great and then build it out for them like space was space planning didn't work out well so they go for the whole thing together what would you recommend like if ted could film way more kids sooner should he do that or should he slow it down so you have time to raise the capital stack for phase two i would say that would be the like i mean it will take that much time for the second phase putting together the capital stack plus like plus the biggest biggest unknown here is that getting the financing for this without any enrollment data there is always an option like if if he's hitting the enrollment target my guess is that it will be easier for any lender to even increase their loan to value there which increase decreases the fundraising need so right now like i have assumed it like on the lower side because i know without any enrollment data like most of the lenders would be like hey we cannot go up above x percent loan to value so okay that's great yeah i mean to be honest to be really honest to don't you i mean you're in charge of the enrollment growth plan for ted because whatever you tell us to do we're going to do because we both know books i didn't i know that we just it's all building dependent and so like you don't have to pick that that was my question zach which which and again i i've written it in my notes of like things to validate is the enrollment ramp up and its validity like i can anything can look good in on excel and like we can build any number here my my bigger question is that like i i don't know enough about this development to say that like can a startup school in roll three hundred fifty students in year one i think that doesn't make me nervous because there were other models where we basically had to get to all twelve hundred kids by year five or something and you know in my head i was like i wasn't sure if you got to get to the whole enrollment to be able to afford any of this and so you want to raise the twelve hundred that made me kind of sick to my stomach i think that it like this is this is not this is basically what marc arzano is proposing and they're a charter application that they get to about six hundred by year by twenty twenty nine i think that that's got to be doable because i think that that's not doable this whole thing is going to crumble and i think we're we're different we're going to make ted have to find money for some transportation so like it's we're forcing him to put a meaningful number of his budget in transportation so that he can until the development is fully built out he can run buses in competition with all of you know d forty nine and even d twenty if he's good so i think that that's really doable i would prefer right whatever the slowest growth plan that you think is works that's what i would prefer because i don't know i don't like these like we're going to get a thousand kids within three years so i think you if you tell me whatever the ideal growth plan is i'm just going to ask you is that is that the slowest that we can do and if you say yes then i'm just going to work with ted and we're going to backwards plan from that growth plan yeah so zach like again without knowing like the school model or or the structure again i can assume based on what i know but my guess is that this this portion so csp is i i've assumed around one point eight million and then my guess is and based on what we have typically seen this will require another two to three million dollars just the operating total or per year oh but total yeah yeah because because you are going in a permanent facility yeah so there will be like some operating gap like because in your initial years you are spending significantly higher so this has to this has to get covered through some startup funding and that is where so this number and this number like we'll have to whoever we are going to for fundraising we'll have to present the whole package because one doesn't work without the other well i would just say the high level and i've got it sorry i've got a hard stop at nine thirty this is super helpful i mean this is really really helpful sudanshu and i think that if you guys can kind of figure out how to chris knows how to repeat these decks but maybe you know no no i'm going to simplify and like again like that was my goal for like validating some of these things with you is that if for norwood like i want to present like a very clear ask and very clear what needs to be true from like other fundraising standpoint what i'm gonna i'm gonna push for pretty hard not that i have any leverage in any of this right it's just that if we do this i would really like that there's a commitment to at least try one bond or mill campaign and be forty nine in the next like three cycles because i still think that if you get that it just solves a lot of problems unless you guys say to me you know how to raise five to ten million dollars for a single school philanthropy outside of colorado springs because this is basically what we're doing with the healthcare school right now where we're saying if bloomberg comes in at five to ten we can kind of do whatever we want if bloomberg doesn't come in we have to do a completely different plan with tracy like it's not even the same school and i think for us we just need to know from kind of your side zach right now my answer to that question is no because like right now i only know dsst to be able to pull this off yeah exactly and dsst has been around for so many years to be able to do it i don't have any other parallels or even my conversations with anshuts and like all the other people who have give to dsst i don't know if they have enough then i would like to frame this almost as we have to take we have to yeah so that's why i was like i wanted to and i need to double check this assumption with lydia again so that then i can frame it as like what needs to be true is bond campaign for this to work yeah and it could be bond or mill to be or mill sorry yeah that terminology like atlas got an extra five percent of their operating funds and yeah that's great because that's that's just my assumption too sudan too is that if we do this we have to have a commitment that csf norwood and legacy are all okay with trying to work with e forty nine in twenty six twenty eight indoor thirty to do something because i just don't i don't have any confidence that ted can raise five million dollars after what you guys put in and what csp puts in after what nora puts in he could get to like a million bucks but if he's got to get to five to seven million dollars in philanthropy i would i would advise him not to do this project because i just don't i couldn't raise that money myself and so i yeah so zach like i think that is the like there are i have taken a list of things to validate to give you an answer to that question in and i'm targeting at least let's say a month for you to get clarity on on this because it requires norwood input it requires like talking to some of the construction like validating construction cost understanding enrollment like all those pieces but again at least like this exercise helped me focus on like hey these are the five things we need to know before we can say a yes or a no to your question i would say through on the construction side you know how frugal brittany is i would call her i would just talk to her about what her assumptions were with that middle school project because she's one of the best when it comes to actually executing these building things like not at your level of financial complexity but like she knows what pink costs and what and she fights truth and nail with everybody over every dollar and so to me if she's like hey the least amount you could build one of these is four hundred fifty i would probably take her out of her word because she knows like even though she had to do some hoops like they just opened that building and i just can't imagine maybe you did a little bit of discount but anyways this is awesome so i'm just gonna tell eric this is what's coming with you guys their conversations with you full capital stack suganchu has the full complexity and roughly you're gonna have they're gonna have to donate land and pre development services and then we're gonna all have to agree to go after a bond ish and it's possible like that's all i'm gonna tell i think that's that's the if that is the
